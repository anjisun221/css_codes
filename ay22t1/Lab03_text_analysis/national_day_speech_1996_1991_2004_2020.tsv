1966_lee_kuan_yew	1	It is useful this evening not so much to go back to the past – the whys and the wherefores – to apportion blame but more to search deep into our hearts to ask if the things we set out to do were right or wrong; were good or bad.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	2	And I say that we have no regrets.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	3	We are completely unrepentant that we set out to build a multiracial and, for some time, a multilingual, multicultural community, to give a satisfying life to the many different kinds of people who foregathered here in over 150 years of the British Raj.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	4	And we, in the end, on balance decided to carry on with our multiracial experiment – if you like to call it – just in Singapore alone rather than be forced into large-scale conflict in Malaysia.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	5	Nothing has altered, not the basic data nor our basic thinking.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	6	What has altered are the circumstances in which we now find ourselvesFrom 1961 to 1963, we fought for merger, to sink ourselves in the identity of a bigger whole.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	7	Between 1963 and 1965, we found ourselves gradually embroiled in something which we half suspected but never quite admitted was possible within such a multi-racial situation.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	8	And in 1965, with decisive suddenness, we found ourselves asunder.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	9	All the while, despite all the political unpleasantness that followed, we were making progress.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	10	Imports went up and so did exports.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	11	These are facts and figures, not fictions of the imagination of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	12	They have checked against every indent that goes in and out of the Port of Singapore Authority.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	13	They have checked against our revenue on the same rates of taxation; the number of factories, the people they employ, the goods they produce, their value; the housing being built.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	14	And they tell a story which we have very little to be ashamed of.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	15	Almost in spite of ourselves, we have forged ahead; revenue has gone up 10 per cent; the economy is surging forwardWe believed – and we still believe – that that salvation lies in an integrated society.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	16	I use the word advisedly – 'integrated' as against 'assimilated'.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	17	I would not imagine for one moment a Singapore Government trying to assimilate everybody.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	18	You know, 75 percent Chinese trying to convert 10 percent Tamils and Hindus and Tamil Muslims and Northern Indian Muslims into good ‘Chinamen’ – or not even good old Chinamen: good old ‘Overseas Chinese’, Singapore brand, Singapore type.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	19	I would not try it; it is not worth the effort.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	20	Nor would I try it with the other groups.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	21	Certainly, not my colleague like Encik Othman who has been here for many, many generations; or even my colleague like Tuan Haji Ya’acob from Kelantan where he was born.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	22	Why should we try the impossible?
1966_lee_kuan_yew	23	But I say integration is possible – not to make us one grey mass against our will, against our feelings, against our inclinations, but to integrate us with common values, common attitudes, a common outlook, certainly a common language and eventually, a common culture.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	24	I think it is reassuring on an anniversary to weigh the odds to see how we have performed, the promises against the performances.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	25	And my experiences of Singapore and her young, active, energetic if somewhat exuberant people is that given honest and effective leadership, an honest administration within which to bring forth themselves, they will make the grade.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	26	""Every year, on this 9th August for many years ahead – how many, I do not know – we will dedicate ourselves anew to consolidate ourselves to survive; and, most important of all, to find an enduring future for what we have built and what our forebears will build up.
1966_lee_kuan_yew	27	Thank you.
1991_goh_chok_tong	1	TRANSCRIPT OF PR1I\1E MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG'SNATIONAL DAY RALLY SPEECH (ENGLISH)
1991_goh_chok_tong	2	ON 11 AUGUST1991Friends and fellow citizens, this is a big occasion for me.
1991_goh_chok_tong	3	It is alsoa difficult occasion.
1991_goh_chok_tong	4	I said that I was not going to wear Mr Lee KuanYew's shoes, but I found myself stepping into his shoes tonight.
1991_goh_chok_tong	5	I am notgoing to follow his act.
1991_goh_chok_tong	6	I am going to walk my own way.
1991_goh_chok_tong	7	I have tobecause, as you know, my knowledge of Malay is minimal.
1991_goh_chok_tong	8	I would haveto spend quite a lot of effort in order to make a speech in Malayafterwards.
1991_goh_chok_tong	9	My knowledge of Mandarin is a little better because I spent sometime over the last two years to learn my Mandarin.
1991_goh_chok_tong	10	But still, as with Malay,I would require the assistance of the auto-cue.
1991_goh_chok_tong	11	You see these twocontraptions over here.
1991_goh_chok_tong	12	They are parts of the auto-cue to assist me in myMalay and Mandarin speeches.(Remarks in Bahasa Melayu and Mandarin).Friends and fellow citizens, when I assumed the premiership inNovember, I discussed with my colleagues how we should pay tribute toMr Lee Kuan Yew.
1991_goh_chok_tong	13	I suggested that we should hold a special session ofParliament in order to pass a resolution to allow members of Parliament topay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
1991_goh_chok_tong	14	My colleagues agreed.
1991_goh_chok_tong	15	I then put it toMr Lee.
1991_goh_chok_tong	16	He said it was not necessary.
1991_goh_chok_tong	17	Here is a man who has given hislife to Singaporeans in order that we can all be better off.
1991_goh_chok_tong	18	Here is a manwho has fought for independence, gave us merdeka, dignity and prosperity.
1991_goh_chok_tong	19	I will be derelict in my duty tonight if I do not ask you to show him ourappreciation.
1991_goh_chok_tong	20	Thank you.
1991_goh_chok_tong	21	I feel much better now.
1991_goh_chok_tong	22	I owe Mr Lee one.
1991_goh_chok_tong	23	Mr Leeand a whole generation of Singaporeans have got us to where we are today.
1991_goh_chok_tong	24	I want to build on your successes.
1991_goh_chok_tong	25	I want to do this by reinforcing inSingaporeans a sense of family.
1991_goh_chok_tong	26	For a country to make progress, we must have a strong sense ofbelonging to one another, of caring for one another.
1991_goh_chok_tong	27	We cannot separatethe communities living in Singapore, say Malays in Geylang Serai, and theChinese in Chinatown, Indians in Serangoon Gardens.
1991_goh_chok_tong	28	If we do that andthe communities do not mix, each community will be isolated fromanother.
1991_goh_chok_tong	29	There will be no sense of relationship.
1991_goh_chok_tong	30	That will spell for bigtrouble for Singapore.
1991_goh_chok_tong	31	If we are not careful, over time, tension wi11 evenbuild up between the communities and the country can even break up.6.
1991_goh_chok_tong	32	I want to illustrate this by pointing to the example of Yugoslavia.
1991_goh_chok_tong	33	Yugoslavia is a multi-ethnic country.
1991_goh_chok_tong	34	It is an artificial country createdafter the First World War.
1991_goh_chok_tong	35	Like Singapore, it is actually not a nation.
1991_goh_chok_tong	36	It isa country created by politicians, but not a nation.
1991_goh_chok_tong	37	There are severalcommunities living within Yugoslavia, but the three main ones are theSerbs, the Croats and the Slavians.
1991_goh_chok_tong	38	The Serbs are Orthodox Christians, orthey belong to the Orthodox Church.
1991_goh_chok_tong	39	They form some 3 7 per cent of thepopulation of Yugoslavia, which is about 23 million people.
1991_goh_chok_tong	40	The Croatsare mainly Roman Catholics.
1991_goh_chok_tong	41	They form 20 per cent of the population.7.
1991_goh_chok_tong	42	You see what is happening in Yugoslavia now.
1991_goh_chok_tong	43	It was heldtogether for over 40 years because there was a strong centre whichcontrolled the people and got them to stay together.
1991_goh_chok_tong	44	After Tito died, thecentre weakened and the latent ethnic tensions and antagonism againemerged.
1991_goh_chok_tong	45	The tensions were always there and they emerged when thecentre became weaker.
1991_goh_chok_tong	46	The different people in Yugoslavia do not considerthemselves one people.
1991_goh_chok_tong	47	They do not want to share the same destiny.
1991_goh_chok_tong	48	TheSlavians want to have their own country.
1991_goh_chok_tong	49	The Croats also want to havetheir own independent country.8.
1991_goh_chok_tong	50	If Singaporean Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians do not begin tocare for one another, to care for each other's welfare, we may go the sameway.
1991_goh_chok_tong	51	It is not easy to build up this sense of family amongst people ofdifferent races, but we must try.
1991_goh_chok_tong	52	We can try and build up an extendedfamily of Singaporeans.
1991_goh_chok_tong	53	To do so, to succeed in our venture, everySingaporean should be treated equally.9.
1991_goh_chok_tong	54	It is important that the rich and powerful are not favoured overordinary Singaporeans.
1991_goh_chok_tong	55	If we do not treat Singaporeans equa11y, there is noreason for ordinary Singaporeans to support the system because the systemonly benefits the rich and the powerful.
1991_goh_chok_tong	56	You cannot have cohesion withinthe country if the country is divided.
1991_goh_chok_tong	57	In fact, the rich and powerful areexploiting the ordinary people.
1991_goh_chok_tong	58	Now, Japan is a cohesive society.
1991_goh_chok_tong	59	It isbecause of this concern over the possibility of loosening this cohesion thattheir securities scandal is causing alarm among Japanese.10.
1991_goh_chok_tong	60	In June this year, the four largest Japanese securities housesNomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi --compensated favoured clients.
1991_goh_chok_tong	61	These are big clients of the four stock houses.
1991_goh_chok_tong	62	They had a priorarrangement that if the stock houses lost money for the big clients, theywould be compensated.
1991_goh_chok_tong	63	But the small investors were not compensated.
1991_goh_chok_tong	64	When this became public knowledge, there was a public outcry.
1991_goh_chok_tong	65	It is notillegal for the stock houses to have this arrangement because they want tohave their clients' business.
1991_goh_chok_tong	66	They can give them a guarantee against losses.
1991_goh_chok_tong	67	It is not illegal, but that is not the point.
1991_goh_chok_tong	68	The worry is that the systemfavours the rich and the powerful.
1991_goh_chok_tong	69	The ordinary people are not part of thisinvestment losses protection scheme.
1991_goh_chok_tong	70	So, this worries the Japanese.11.
1991_goh_chok_tong	71	We cannot allow that to happen in Singapore.
1991_goh_chok_tong	72	We certainly do notwant this to happen to Singapore.
1991_goh_chok_tong	73	We got to ensure that our system is suchthat it would not favour the rich and powerful because if there is such asystem, we cannot build a cohesive nation.
1991_goh_chok_tong	74	We will not be able toreinforce this sense of family togetherness among Singaporeans.12.
1991_goh_chok_tong	75	The examples in Singapore must be set by people at the top.
1991_goh_chok_tong	76	ThePresident, the Prime Minister, the Cabinet ministers, the civil servants, theChief Executives of corporations, the successful businessmen.
1991_goh_chok_tong	77	They mustset the example of not extracting from the system at the benefit of ordinarySingaporeans.
1991_goh_chok_tong	78	But you know we cannot legislate for honesty.
1991_goh_chok_tong	79	It is notpossible to have legislation to make a person honest.
1991_goh_chok_tong	80	But we can havelegislation to prevent people from inclining to be dishonest because theycan be punished by the system if they are inclined to be dishonest.
1991_goh_chok_tong	81	It is forthis reason that when we were discussing this Elected Presidency Bill, wedecided to include a provision that should the Prime Minister not supportCPIB when the CPIB is investigating into ministers, the CPIB could stillinvestigate if the elected President concurs.
1991_goh_chok_tong	82	Now, I was going to be thePrime Minister
1991_goh_chok_tong	83	but I was more than happy to subject myself to thatadditional check and balance.
1991_goh_chok_tong	84	It is necessary to set an example forSingaporeans that we run a fair system and people at the top are subject tosimilar checks and balances as for ordinary Singaporeans.13.
1991_goh_chok_tong	85	It is more important, however, to ensure that honest people with theright values are in charge of key institutions, Parliament, the Civil Service,MAS, statutory boards and so on.
1991_goh_chok_tong	86	Now, again, I can give you an exampleof what would have happened had we did not have honest men in charge ofMAS.
1991_goh_chok_tong	87	You know the BCCI case, the Bank of Credit and CommerceInternational.
1991_goh_chok_tong	88	It is the biggest bank fraud in the world --bank used by gunrunners, drug smugglers, corrupt dictators, money launderers.
1991_goh_chok_tong	89	This bankhas a presence in 69 countries.
1991_goh_chok_tong	90	It tried to apply for a branch to be openedin Singapore, but it did not succeed14.
1991_goh_chok_tong	91	It first applied for a license in 1973.
1991_goh_chok_tong	92	It was rejected because thebank had no track record.
1991_goh_chok_tong	93	But it persisted several times using highpowered intermediaries to get the decision reversed.
1991_goh_chok_tong	94	They used Mr VanOenen who was the head of the Bank of America branch in Singapore inthe 1970s.
1991_goh_chok_tong	95	He was a man who helped us to start the Asian currency Unit,so there was a certain obhgation to him.
1991_goh_chok_tong	96	The bank also used a formerBritish Prime Minister who is close to Mr Lee Kuan Yew but still the replywas "no".
1991_goh_chok_tong	97	Successive managing directors of MAS --Dr
1991_goh_chok_tong	98	Goh Keng Swee,the late Mr Hon Sui Sen, Yong Pung How, Richard Hu, Joe Pillay and LeeEk Tieng --all turned down the apphcatlon.
1991_goh_chok_tong	99	They based their decision onthe simple criterion of whether the bank was reputable or not.
1991_goh_chok_tong	100	In otherwords, they upheld the high standards and principles necessary forSingapore to succeed as a financial centre.
1991_goh_chok_tong	101	I thank my lucky stars that wehave such men in charge.
1991_goh_chok_tong	102	Otherwise, I will be picking up the problems, notMr Lee Kuan Yew because he is no longer in charge.15.
1991_goh_chok_tong	103	Just look at the Hong Kong depositors.
1991_goh_chok_tong	104	l understand that theydeposited over US$1 bmion.
1991_goh_chok_tong	105	Most of the funds wm be lost.
1991_goh_chok_tong	106	They cannotbe recovered.
1991_goh_chok_tong	107	Now, had that happened to Singaporeans, you can imaginethe problem that we will be facing now.
1991_goh_chok_tong	108	Trying to calm downSingaporeans over their losses in this bank because we gave them thelicense to operate in Singapore.
1991_goh_chok_tong	109	The moral of the story is -always havehonest men with high principles and sound judgement in charge of yourlives.
1991_goh_chok_tong	110	Stick to those principles and we will be safe.16.
1991_goh_chok_tong	111	We've made great strides over the last 26 years for many reasons.
1991_goh_chok_tong	112	But one major reason for our success is the system which we nm --meritocracy.
1991_goh_chok_tong	113	The system allows individuals to pursue their interests, toacquire skrns, to maximise their potential, to go as high up as they can go.
1991_goh_chok_tong	114	There is incentive for them to acquire knowledge, skills because when youapply those knowledge and ski11s to good use, you are rewardedaccordingly.
1991_goh_chok_tong	115	You get paid wages, bonuses related to productivity.
1991_goh_chok_tong	116	Now,this system makes us competitive and productive, both as individuals andas a nation.
1991_goh_chok_tong	117	It is necessary therefore, for us to preserve this system, to keepit going, to enhance it because without this drive towards competitiveness,we would not be running the world's busiest port in terms of shippingtonnages and in terms of container traffic.
1991_goh_chok_tong	118	Changi Airport would not havebeen voted world's number one for three years in succession by a Britishtravel magazine.17.
1991_goh_chok_tong	119	The World Economic Forum, which is a Swiss organisationtracking the competitiveness of nations, has published this year's annualreport.
1991_goh_chok_tong	120	So, I asked for a copy of the report just to look at the factors whichthey regard as important for a nation to compete in the world.
1991_goh_chok_tong	121	I would liketo quote an extract from the report, to give you an idea of the fundamentalswhich they look out for, because if you understand what this WorldEconomic Forum was looking out for, you will be better able to understandthe factors which are necessary for Singapore's success:"The fimdamentals which in the past have ensured the continuoussuccess of cmmtr;es such as .Japan, Germany, ,\'witzerland andSingapore are now well-known.
1991_goh_chok_tong	122	There is a strong emphasis on goodinfi·astructure, a continuous technological flow, a dynamicinternational orientation, a conservative monetary and budgetarypohcy, and stahle socio-polihcal environment.
1991_goh_chok_tong	123	A sign?ficant fc1ctoris
1991_goh_chok_tong	124	the decisive impact of education and values on competitiveness.
1991_goh_chok_tong	125	"18.
1991_goh_chok_tong	126	Note education and values on competitiveness.
1991_goh_chok_tong	127	"The four nations mentioned above share an excellent educationalsystem wh;ch seems to place less emphasis on creating geniusesthan on upgrading the average competence level of the population.
1991_goh_chok_tong	128	They also have in common a system of values based on hard ·work,loyalty and team spirit. ··19.
1991_goh_chok_tong	129	Team spirit, I want to emphasise this because that is my theme fortonight.
1991_goh_chok_tong	130	The combination of excellence in education and tenacity in valuesseems to be an unbeatable ticket for world competitiveness.
1991_goh_chok_tong	131	Now, we arecompetitive.
1991_goh_chok_tong	132	My worry is whether we're able to maintain the cooperationand cohesion in our society in order that we can remain competitive.
1991_goh_chok_tong	133	Inorder that we can make progress.20.
1991_goh_chok_tong	134	In the past, everyone believed that with effort and hard work, youcould make it to the top.
1991_goh_chok_tong	135	Indeed, many sons and daughters ofwasherwomen, taxi-drivers, and labourers have made it to the top.
1991_goh_chok_tong	136	So,they supported the able and the bright.
1991_goh_chok_tong	137	They encouraged the able and thebright to do better, because they were hoping their children too can dobetter.
1991_goh_chok_tong	138	And when the able became successful, they graduated, they becameprofessionals.
1991_goh_chok_tong	139	They, in tum, came back to help the less successful.
1991_goh_chok_tong	140	Therewas that sense of obligation to society.
1991_goh_chok_tong	141	They have made it through thesystem, and they felt that they should come back and serve.
1991_goh_chok_tong	142	Many of ourmembers of Parliament and ministers belong to that category.
1991_goh_chok_tong	143	They havesucceeded.
1991_goh_chok_tong	144	They are successful.
1991_goh_chok_tong	145	They feel that it is their duty to serve thecountry, to serve the community organisations.
1991_goh_chok_tong	146	I suspect that there is aloosening of this bond.
1991_goh_chok_tong	147	I can see emerging signs.21.
1991_goh_chok_tong	148	The less able, I can sense, are beginning to envy the success of themore able.
1991_goh_chok_tong	149	And amongst the more able, there is a certain self-centredness.
1991_goh_chok_tong	150	This sense of obligation is not as strong as those in their 30s and 40s, oreven early 50s.
1991_goh_chok_tong	151	The less successful resent our emphasis on independentschools, programme for the gifted children -our encouragement forgraduates to marry graduates.
1991_goh_chok_tong	152	They see this as our helping the able whoalready are talented.
1991_goh_chok_tong	153	They do not see the need for government to spendmore funds, more efforts to help those who are already doing well inschool.
1991_goh_chok_tong	154	It is not that they object to the concept of independent schools.
1991_goh_chok_tong	155	Itis that their children cannot make it to independent schools.
1991_goh_chok_tong	156	If we spendmore funds on upgrading the quality of independent schools, set up moreindependent schools, they fear that the gap in performance between thosein independent schools and those in government schools will widen.
1991_goh_chok_tong	157	So,they brand the independent schools as ""ehtlst".22.
1991_goh_chok_tong	158	In my recent walkabout, one member of the pubhc came to me andasked me, why do we have gifted programmes for the talented?
1991_goh_chok_tong	159	Hesuggested to me that we should in fact scrap the entire programme.
1991_goh_chok_tong	160	I askedhim why.
1991_goh_chok_tong	161	The reason was what I told you just now.
1991_goh_chok_tong	162	The children arealready gifted, why spend more on them to make them even better, to makethem perform even better than others who cannot make it to theprogramme.
1991_goh_chok_tong	163	So, his suggestion is not to find ways to help those who arenot doing so well, but for us to scrap the gifted programme for the betterendowed children.
1991_goh_chok_tong	164	To me, this is a suggestion that we should level down.
1991_goh_chok_tong	165	Now, jf the man were alone in this suggestion, then I would not worry.
1991_goh_chok_tong	166	But I have been around in several walkabouts, meeting people, I can feelthat quite a few Singaporeans share the sentiment, that since we cannotmake it to independent schools, we cannot make it to the giftedprogramme, let's not have them, let's level down.
1991_goh_chok_tong	167	This is a very dangerousdesire.
1991_goh_chok_tong	168	It represents the kind of egalitarian thinking that got communistcountries into trouble.
1991_goh_chok_tong	169	You know, the communist countries --SovietUnion, Yugoslavia, Romania, China --they are all in a mess.
1991_goh_chok_tong	170	It is becauseof this levelling down in the societies.23.
1991_goh_chok_tong	171	I first went to a communist country in 1971 to Beijing.
1991_goh_chok_tong	172	I went thereas part of NOL's delegation to try and charter ships to them.
1991_goh_chok_tong	173	Took us along time to arrive in Beijing in those days.
1991_goh_chok_tong	174	You have to first go to HongKong to apply the China Travel Service for your pass, stay overnight inHong
1991_goh_chok_tong	175	Kong, then go by train to Canton, stay overnight, and then fly toBeijing.
1991_goh_chok_tong	176	When we arrived in Beijing, it was after 7pm.
1991_goh_chok_tong	177	We were hungry,we were famished because they did not serve you on the plane fromCanton to Beijing.
1991_goh_chok_tong	178	But their best hotel, which was Beijing Hotel, refusedto serve us any dinner.
1991_goh_chok_tong	179	Dinner time was from 5 to 7, if you don't make it you don't have food.
1991_goh_chok_tong	180	Well, that 1s the system which they run m acommunist country.24.
1991_goh_chok_tong	181	I also took the trouble to visit the communes.
1991_goh_chok_tong	182	When I went to acommune, I saw hundreds of workers out in the field, flags fluttering away,bright colours, blue, red, ye11ow, the communist flag, then loudspeakerblaring revolutionary music, workers carrying their tools, working in avery sma11 area.
1991_goh_chok_tong	183	Then my mind flashed back to the year which I spent inWilliam's College, when I visited a farm in Iowa.
1991_goh_chok_tong	184	There, one man, onefanner with one tractor looked after acres of land.
1991_goh_chok_tong	185	So, the lesson wasbrought home to me vividly.
1991_goh_chok_tong	186	You level down, everyone is paid equalwage, you need hundreds of workers to man one sma11 plot of land.
1991_goh_chok_tong	187	In theStates where they are paid by incentives, one man, one tractor, big farmland.
1991_goh_chok_tong	188	So, I understood the meaning of low productivity for the communistcountry.25.
1991_goh_chok_tong	189	When I first went to China, the waiters and waitresses weregrumpy, they didn't serve us well.
1991_goh_chok_tong	190	I have been back to China several timessince.
1991_goh_chok_tong	191	This time, the waiters and waitresses smile.
1991_goh_chok_tong	192	They serve you, theyhave name-tags with English names so that you can remember them
1991_goh_chok_tong	193	betterwhen they give you good service.
1991_goh_chok_tong	194	Well, China has changed.
1991_goh_chok_tong	195	It has learntthat you need to reform the system to reward people accordingly.
1991_goh_chok_tong	196	So thereis hope for China.26.
1991_goh_chok_tong	197	But I do not think there is any hope for the Soviet Union, not for along, long time any\\ay.
1991_goh_chok_tong	198	I visited Moscow in 1990 just before I took over,a few months before I took over.
1991_goh_chok_tong	199	First time, I was advised to bring myown toilet paper.
1991_goh_chok_tong	200	So, I asked the person that advised me, why should Ibring my own toilet paper?
1991_goh_chok_tong	201	The answer was the toilet paper in the SovietUnion is non-absorbent.
1991_goh_chok_tong	202	And true enough, at the guest-house, the toiletpaper was non-absorbent but the writing paper is absorbent.
1991_goh_chok_tong	203	I took thetrouble to go to a supermarket and I got the shock of my life.
1991_goh_chok_tong	204	The shelveswere empty, long queue of people just trying to buy a few pieces of meat,few eggs and so on.
1991_goh_chok_tong	205	Then, I understood why.27.
1991_goh_chok_tong	206	When Premier Rizkov came to Singapore, he asked to v1s1t asupermarket in Singapore.
1991_goh_chok_tong	207	Yeo Ning Hong who accompanied him told methat Premier Rizkov took an orange, took an apple, fondled it lovingly,wondering how Singaporeans could afford such beautiful apples andoranges.
1991_goh_chok_tong	208	So, having been to Moscow, I understood why.
1991_goh_chok_tong	209	The lesson for usis that if you level down a society, you want everybody to be equal, youare not sharing prosperity.
1991_goh_chok_tong	210	You are sharing poverty.
1991_goh_chok_tong	211	It is this sullen egalitarian streak in the Russians which prevent them from changing thesystem.28.
1991_goh_chok_tong	212	Hedrick Smith, in his book ""The New Russians" wrote about theRussians.
1991_goh_chok_tong	213	He had several stories.
1991_goh_chok_tong	214	I will just tell you two of them.
1991_goh_chok_tong	215	One isthat the Russian peasant cannot stand someone better off than him.
1991_goh_chok_tong	216	If hesees someone with a car, he will think dark thoughts: This so and so withhis car, I would like to kill him for living better than I do.
1991_goh_chok_tong	217	That is the wayhe thinks.
1991_goh_chok_tong	218	There was this lucky peasant who was given a wish by God.
1991_goh_chok_tong	219	God said to him, I will give you a wish.
1991_goh_chok_tong	220	You can have anything you want,a car, a house, millions of roubles, anything you want.
1991_goh_chok_tong	221	So, of course thepeasant was very happy.
1991_goh_chok_tong	222	He began to fantasise what wishes he could have.
1991_goh_chok_tong	223	The wealth that he could have from God.
1991_goh_chok_tong	224	And God says, remember,whatever I give you, I would double it for your neighbour.
1991_goh_chok_tong	225	So, thisRussian peasant, his face dropped, he agonised over it because he couldnot bear the fact that his neighbour would be twice as rich as he is.
1991_goh_chok_tong	226	Then,after a while, he told God, I will tell you what my wish is.
1991_goh_chok_tong	227	Take out one ofmy eyes so that my neighbour would lose both his eyes.29.
1991_goh_chok_tong	228	This envy of someone better off, this impulse of not letting anyoneget ahead, if it occurs in a society, I think that would be the end ofSingaporeans.
1991_goh_chok_tong	229	We cannot afford to pull your neighbour's shirt in order toprevent him from going faster.
1991_goh_chok_tong	230	This is why Gorbachev finds it so difficultto introduce his reforms that would reward good work.
1991_goh_chok_tong	231	In April 1990, hedeclared, '"If we do not break out of this foolish system of wage levelling,we would ruin everything that is alive in our people, we shall suffocate.''So, Gorbachev understands that they got to remove this wage levellingsystem in the Soviet Union.30.
1991_goh_chok_tong	232	The way for us to make progress is to level up by maximising thepotential of everyone.
1991_goh_chok_tong	233	We have to maximise the potential of the able, thetalented.
1991_goh_chok_tong	234	But not just the able and talented, we should maximise thepotential of everyone.
1991_goh_chok_tong	235	Of course, if we spot a bright kid, our job is to makesure that that bright kid can go as far as he can.
1991_goh_chok_tong	236	Because you need all thebright kids that we can get hold of to tum them into professionals, intomanagers, into doctors and so on, so that they can manage the country.
1991_goh_chok_tong	237	Now, there is a Chinese proverb (in Mandarin).
1991_goh_chok_tong	238	Easier to raise an armythan find a general.
1991_goh_chok_tong	239	So, that is our philosophy when we say we try andmaximise the potential of everyone, if we try and push the able to the limit.31.
1991_goh_chok_tong	240	The SAF has some 300,000 soldiers.
1991_goh_chok_tong	241	You know how manygenerals we have?
1991_goh_chok_tong	242	So easy to raise 300,000 soldiers
1991_goh_chok_tong	243	but we have only 14generals and that includes Lee Hsien Loong and George Yeo who are non-active generals.
1991_goh_chok_tong	244	So, my philosophy is a simple one.
1991_goh_chok_tong	245	If we can find an ableperson, we will allow that able person to rise as far as he can go.
1991_goh_chok_tong	246	If you donot have such an able person, you \\'ill not be able to have your bigorganisations built up.
1991_goh_chok_tong	247	Take the case of SIA.
1991_goh_chok_tong	248	Joe Pillay and his team builtup SIA.
1991_goh_chok_tong	249	One man who did not know anything about airline was put incharge because he was an able man.
1991_goh_chok_tong	250	He built up SIA, which is today'smost profitable airline in the world.
1991_goh_chok_tong	251	SIA employs some 13,000 people andcontributes five per cent to our GDP.
1991_goh_chok_tong	252	That is a very big contribution fromone single company.32.
1991_goh_chok_tong	253	I mentioned Mr Pillay because he is partly responsible for mybeing here todav.
1991_goh_chok_tong	254	I worked for him when I first started work in theEconomic Planning Unit.
1991_goh_chok_tong	255	He was the Deputy Secretary in charge.
1991_goh_chok_tong	256	He sentme to Williams College.
1991_goh_chok_tong	257	I did not apply for it.
1991_goh_chok_tong	258	He got the fonn.
1991_goh_chok_tong	259	He askedme to apply for it.
1991_goh_chok_tong	260	Then I went to William's College.
1991_goh_chok_tong	261	Before I left for theuniversity, he invited me to his house for dinner.
1991_goh_chok_tong	262	So, he cared for a staffwho worked for him whom he thought can be groomed to do bigger things.33.
1991_goh_chok_tong	263	When I came back from Williams College, Prime Minister Lee waslooking for a Principal Private Secretary.
1991_goh_chok_tong	264	He asked for me to appearbefore him for an interview.
1991_goh_chok_tong	265	I was interviewed and he told me that hewould arrange for me to report to him to work as his PPS.
1991_goh_chok_tong	266	So I went backand told Joe Pillay that.
1991_goh_chok_tong	267	Joe Pillay hit the roof.
1991_goh_chok_tong	268	He said, "I did not sendyou to Williams College in order that you can be the Prime Minister'sPrincipal Private Secretary''.
1991_goh_chok_tong	269	I do know how he did it, but I never ended upas Mr Lee's Principal Private Secretary.
1991_goh_chok_tong	270	I therefore have great respect forJoe Pillay, a civil servant who was able to stand up to a Prime Minister.34.
1991_goh_chok_tong	271	The point that I am making is - I am a product of this policy.
1991_goh_chok_tong	272	Whenthe senior officer finds a junior officer able to learn, acquire the skills andknowledge, he takes an interest in the junior officer.
1991_goh_chok_tong	273	He sends him off onscholarship.
1991_goh_chok_tong	274	So, I have benefited from that policy and I want to continuethat policy.
1991_goh_chok_tong	275	So, I take a personal interest in able officers, in able people,not just those in the civil service.
1991_goh_chok_tong	276	Talent scouting Singaporeans, finding outwhere they are, trying to get them into the system and making sure thatthey can maximise their talent and later on, use them for Singapore.35.
1991_goh_chok_tong	277	I am therefore very happy that among this year's President'sscholars, of the four, two came from humble backgrounds.
1991_goh_chok_tong	278	One of them,his father is a taxi driver, mother is a room stewardess.
1991_goh_chok_tong	279	The other, thefather is a merchant having only a secondary education.
1991_goh_chok_tong	280	The mother only aprimary education.
1991_goh_chok_tong	281	So, two out of four.
1991_goh_chok_tong	282	I checked up on the total figuresfor President's scholars.
1991_goh_chok_tong	283	Some 40 per cent of our President's scholars cam from humble beginnings.
1991_goh_chok_tong	284	They lived in HDB flats.
1991_goh_chok_tong	285	So, it is a systemwhich a11ows people to go up to the top and this is a system I want topreserve.36.
1991_goh_chok_tong	286	In order for us to succeed in preserving this system, there is a flipside to the coin.
1991_goh_chok_tong	287	The able must have that sense of obligation to help theless able because society as a whole has accepted this system.
1991_goh_chok_tong	288	If the abledoes not have this sense of obligation to help the slower learners, then youraverage Singaporean is not going to support your able.
1991_goh_chok_tong	289	He is going toresent our spending more money on the able.
1991_goh_chok_tong	290	But if the able comes backand helps others in society, then the others can see the benefit which weenjoy from the able.
1991_goh_chok_tong	291	So, I would like to urge Singaporeans who aresuccessful to develop this sense of obligation to society, to help otherSingaporeans who are not as able as themselves.37.
1991_goh_chok_tong	292	I feel so strongly on this because I have been reading The ,",'traitsTimes' national supplement on the views and attitudes of youngerSingaporeans.
1991_goh_chok_tong	293	You read the views of the over-20s, the views of the babyboomers, the 30s and 40s, you find that there is a difference in theiroutlook.
1991_goh_chok_tong	294	The younger Singaporeans are self-centred, they are confident,they are successful, they know that more money will come their waybecause jobs are available in great abundance.
1991_goh_chok_tong	295	They can afford to carve acareer for themselves without worrying too much about society.38.
1991_goh_chok_tong	296	I was reading the sma11 print in an article.
1991_goh_chok_tong	297	The taxi-driver wascomplaining, one taxi-driver was complaining.
1991_goh_chok_tong	298	He said, I worked andworked and worked until I die.
1991_goh_chok_tong	299	My son, he spends a11 my money with hisgirlfriend in the coffee house.
1991_goh_chok_tong	300	Well, if that is going to be the attitude ofyounger Singaporeans and in particular, the successful Singaporeans, thenwe must expect the bond which we have built up over the years to loosenbecause each is looking at his own career.
1991_goh_chok_tong	301	This complacent "me-first''attitude will destroy the fabric of society.39.
1991_goh_chok_tong	302	Look at the British.
1991_goh_chok_tong	303	Same people, but the working class loathe theupper class.
1991_goh_chok_tong	304	I suppose the upper class also, in a sense, loathe the workingclass.
1991_goh_chok_tong	305	So, there is this division between them.
1991_goh_chok_tong	306	So, the working classwithholds cooperation from the managers, from your upper class.
1991_goh_chok_tong	307	TheBritish trade unions, some years ago, they were trying to wreck the wholesystem because they could not see themselves benefiting from the system.
1991_goh_chok_tong	308	Mrs Thatcher did a great job in breaking up the trade unions, in destroyingpolitical trade union leader, Arthur Scargill.
1991_goh_chok_tong	309	She got the unions to workwith the management, but there is no sense of cooperation.
1991_goh_chok_tong	310	The unions and the workers work because they have to, but they withhold activecooperation from management.40.
1991_goh_chok_tong	311	I am aware that we have been, over the last few years, emphasisingthis aspect of maximising the potential of your able, getting your giftedSingaporeans to go as far as they can.
1991_goh_chok_tong	312	Over the next few years, I want tobalance our policy of levelling up with programmes for the averageSingaporeans.
1991_goh_chok_tong	313	In particular, assistance programmes for slow learners, orslower learners.
1991_goh_chok_tong	314	I want to concentrate on three basic areas: education,health and housing.
1991_goh_chok_tong	315	On education, we are on the right track.
1991_goh_chok_tong	316	We havebroken out from the trap of uniformity and mediocrity with independentschools.
1991_goh_chok_tong	317	After some years, when we have more experience, we shouldgive more autonomy to government schools, so that within governmentschools, there will be schools which also have the flexibility to experiment,to introduce better programmes for the students.
1991_goh_chok_tong	318	There would also be somecompetition between government schools.
1991_goh_chok_tong	319	I believe competition would begood for the schools because they would then be competing for students,competing for teachers, and the net result will be higher standards for thestudents.41.
1991_goh_chok_tong	320	We will be introducing Edusave next year.
1991_goh_chok_tong	321	Again, we will run it.
1991_goh_chok_tong	322	Allow the funds to be used only for enrichment programmes likegymnastics, dance classes, art classes.
1991_goh_chok_tong	323	But after a while, when we havemore experience, we can then allow the funds in Edusave to be used to paypart of school fees.
1991_goh_chok_tong	324	Because when you have autonomous schools,independent schools, there will be a range of school fees, there will be arange of schools catering to varying capabilities of Singaporeans, thenEdusave can be liberalised.
1991_goh_chok_tong	325	The students then will have a choice to shopfor the best school they want to go to.
1991_goh_chok_tong	326	They need not confine themselvesto neighbourhood schools.
1991_goh_chok_tong	327	They can look for the best schools.
1991_goh_chok_tong	328	If the bestschools charge a higher school fee, we should allow them to use theirEdusave funds to pay for part of the school fees.42.
1991_goh_chok_tong	329	We are now spending 3.5 per cent of our GDP on education.
1991_goh_chok_tong	330	Weintend to spend four per cent.
1991_goh_chok_tong	331	Secondary schools will be turned into singlesession schools.
1991_goh_chok_tong	332	Even as we are implementing a third polytechnic, we areplanning a fourth polytechnic.
1991_goh_chok_tong	333	Our target is to have some 40 per cent ofour students, or post-secondary students go to polytechnic.
1991_goh_chok_tong	334	We willrevamp our Vocational and Industrial Training Board into a new Instituteof Technical Education.
1991_goh_chok_tong	335	NUS and NTU will expand their intakes.
1991_goh_chok_tong	336	Then wewill start an open university, encourage distance learning.
1991_goh_chok_tong	337	Education mustbe on a continuing basis.
1991_goh_chok_tong	338	One should never stop learning, one should learnall the time.
1991_goh_chok_tong	339	So, all these programmes will be for the benefit of the bulk of the Singaporeans.
1991_goh_chok_tong	340	This is balancing our earlier programme for the gifted inour society.43.
1991_goh_chok_tong	341	Home Ownership.
1991_goh_chok_tong	342	Ninety per cent of Singaporeans now own theirown homes.
1991_goh_chok_tong	343	That leaves 10 per cent \\ho still live in rental flats.
1991_goh_chok_tong	344	I haveasked the Minister for National Development to see how we can get this l 0per cent to also own their own flats.
1991_goh_chok_tong	345	I believe if we have more liberalfinancial programmes, financial assistance, to get them to own their flats,we can succeed in raising the home ownership percentage from 90 to 95per cent.
1991_goh_chok_tong	346	I do not think it is possible to achieve I 00 per cent because therewill always be a group of Singaporeans whose income will be so low orwho will be unable to keep the funds they earn to own their own flats.
1991_goh_chok_tong	347	Soif we can achieve 95 per cent home ownership in Singapore, I will regardthat as achieving full home ownership for Singaporeans.
1991_goh_chok_tong	348	So that is thetarget we are aiming for.
1991_goh_chok_tong	349	We will be coming up with programmes to assistthat 5 per cent to own their own homes.
1991_goh_chok_tong	350	The 5 per cent who now live inrental flats.
1991_goh_chok_tong	351	For the rest, we can still help them.
1991_goh_chok_tong	352	We can refurbish theirflats, we can improve their surroundings so that even those living in rentalblocks can enjoy a higher quality of life, a higher quality of environment,living in HDB rental flats.44.
1991_goh_chok_tong	353	When I was looking at HDB's problems, I realised that there is alsoa group of Singaporeans who requires assistance.
1991_goh_chok_tong	354	That is the singles.
1991_goh_chok_tong	355	Ourrule now does not allow the singles to own their own home by himself orby herself.
1991_goh_chok_tong	356	He has got to do it jointly with somebody else.
1991_goh_chok_tong	357	I will ask theMinister to look into this to see how we can facilitate the singles to eitherrent or own HOB flats.
1991_goh_chok_tong	358	We can announce the scheme later on once theMinister has formulated a proper scheme to cater to the singles.
1991_goh_chok_tong	359	By theway, there are some 19,000 single men over 40 years and some 37,000females over 35 years.45.
1991_goh_chok_tong	360	There is another HDB policy, which I would like to change.
1991_goh_chok_tong	361	Wehave been trying to free the rules and regulations, which govern homeownership of HDB flats so that the homeowners can be, like the privatehomeowners.
1991_goh_chok_tong	362	Since 90 per cent of Singaporeans now own their ownhomes, I think we can allow the HDB lessees to also invest in privateresidential properties.
1991_goh_chok_tong	363	That is provided they live in their HDB flats.
1991_goh_chok_tong	364	Again, this is not a firm decision.
1991_goh_chok_tong	365	This is something, which I want to do.
1991_goh_chok_tong	366	Iwill ask Dhanabalan to look into this to see how we can liberalise to allowHDB lessees to invest in private residential homes.46.
1991_goh_chok_tong	367	Health.
1991_goh_chok_tong	368	I know Singaporeans are concerned over rising healthcosts.
1991_goh_chok_tong	369	So are we because health costs are indeed rising.
1991_goh_chok_tong	370	I take an interest health because when I ,vas young, I lost my father at an early age.
1991_goh_chok_tong	371	Oneday, I was summoned from school to appear by the bedside of my father.
1991_goh_chok_tong	372	He was dying from tuberculosis.
1991_goh_chok_tong	373	His last words to me were, "Look afteryour mother.
1991_goh_chok_tong	374	Look after your brother and sisters, study hard.''
1991_goh_chok_tong	375	That night,he died.
1991_goh_chok_tong	376	So I know the meaning to a family of someone dyingprematurely.
1991_goh_chok_tong	377	So if I can help, I will try and save someone from dyingprematurely for his sake and for his family's sake.4 7.
1991_goh_chok_tong	378	I would therefore make sure that every Singaporean can affordessential healthcare.
1991_goh_chok_tong	379	I will ensure that Singaporeans can afford treatmentin hospitals.
1991_goh_chok_tong	380	"C" Class beds will always be affordable to average lowincome worker with Medisave. ·"82'' class beds will always remainaffordable to the average lower middle-income Singaporean.
1991_goh_chok_tong	381	We willcontinue to provide large subsidies to the Ministry of Health to subsidise Cand B2 beds and together with the Medisave plus the subsidy, which willbe given by the government, you should have enough to pay for yourhealth.
1991_goh_chok_tong	382	We have done our calculations.
1991_goh_chok_tong	383	So long as there is economicgrowth 5 to 7 per cent a year and so long as we all contribute to ourMedisave and we continue to inject subsidy into the system, you will beable to afford your C and B2 beds.
1991_goh_chok_tong	384	This is for the average Singaporean.
1991_goh_chok_tong	385	Now, for the very poor like the odd job labourer or those who arefrequently sick, their Medi save will not be enough.
1991_goh_chok_tong	386	For that group, we cantop up their Medisave.48.
1991_goh_chok_tong	387	Government will set up a medical endowment fund.
1991_goh_chok_tong	388	So every year,from economic growth, we will dock off a certain sum of money and put itinto medical endowment fund.
1991_goh_chok_tong	389	My rough estimate at the moment is, wewill need about 5 billion, over the longer term, to give you a stream ofincome to provide the funds to help the very poor and the frequently sick.
1991_goh_chok_tong	390	This is a ballpark figure.
1991_goh_chok_tong	391	We can target to put aside $300 million to $500million per year into this medical endowment fund or Medifund.
1991_goh_chok_tong	392	It is notwelfare.
1991_goh_chok_tong	393	We are not going to give money away.49.
1991_goh_chok_tong	394	Welfare health system will not work.
1991_goh_chok_tong	395	The Chinese are now tryingto charge for their health services.
1991_goh_chok_tong	396	The Russians have large number ofdoctors but the system is in a mess.
1991_goh_chok_tong	397	Free system abused by the people, toohigh demand and the whole system is unable to cope.
1991_goh_chok_tong	398	So Medifund is nota welfare scheme.
1991_goh_chok_tong	399	It is a safety net in case Singaporeans find themselveswithout Medisave to pay for their health services.
1991_goh_chok_tong	400	For the averageSingaporean who works, together with the subsidy, you should be able toafford the fees charged by hospitals, whether they are restructured orgovernment hospitals.
1991_goh_chok_tong	401	But for the very poor, the casual labourer, thechronic sick, the frequently sick, there will be this safety net.
1991_goh_chok_tong	402	This way, Singaporeans can be sure that their healthcare needs would be taken careof in the future.50.
1991_goh_chok_tong	403	I also want to give special consideration to one group ofSingaporeans -the older Singaporeans who do not have sufficientmedisave.
1991_goh_chok_tong	404	Medisave started too late in their lives.
1991_goh_chok_tong	405	They were probably intheir 50s.
1991_goh_chok_tong	406	So they would not have sufficient funds in their Medisave.
1991_goh_chok_tong	407	Nowwhen this fund is set up, I will pay some attention to the needs of thisgroup.
1991_goh_chok_tong	408	This is our gesture of recognising the contribution of the olderSingaporeans in building Singapore.51.
1991_goh_chok_tong	409	I cannot resist the line that you must keep fit in order to avoidincurring unnecessary health expenditure.
1991_goh_chok_tong	410	Health is your primaryresponsibility.
1991_goh_chok_tong	411	You have just got to keep yourself fit and do not justdepend on your Medifund or your Medisave.
1991_goh_chok_tong	412	In the US, they discriminateagainst those with unhealthy lifestyles.
1991_goh_chok_tong	413	You know the medical benefitswhich union members enjoy, which employees enjoy.
1991_goh_chok_tong	414	Over here, whetheryou smoke, whether you take fast food regularly, whether you are notexercising regularly, you enjoy the same medical benefit as somebody whojogs everyday, who stays trim, who does not smoke.
1991_goh_chok_tong	415	I think this is mostunfair to those who keep fit.
1991_goh_chok_tong	416	Well, the US system discriminates againstthose who do not keep fit.
1991_goh_chok_tong	417	So perhaps we should get our employers to seewhat they can do about this.
1991_goh_chok_tong	418	Maybe give some incentives for those whostay fit.
1991_goh_chok_tong	419	For example, contributing a sum to their Medisave for not usingmedical benefits for that year.
1991_goh_chok_tong	420	But we will be starting a campaign soon toget Singaporeans to keep fit.52.
1991_goh_chok_tong	421	We have published our programme in the next lap.
1991_goh_chok_tong	422	We cansucceed in implementing the next lap only if we have your support.
1991_goh_chok_tong	423	It isour programme, but without your support, we cannot implement it.
1991_goh_chok_tong	424	Andfor the programme to succeed, the able must care for the average andslower learners.
1991_goh_chok_tong	425	Only then can a bond be built up between the able and theothers.
1991_goh_chok_tong	426	Only then can we reinforce in Singaporeans this sense of family.
1991_goh_chok_tong	427	Only then can we achieve our goal of having an extended family ofSingaporeans.53.
1991_goh_chok_tong	428	I have originally thought of having the next general elections onlyin 1993, but my colleagues have told me that grassroots leaders have toldthem that people are supportive of my new open, consultative style andthey think I can improve the chances
1991_goh_chok_tong	429	and they think we can improve thechances of success for the next lap if we go for early general election to geta strong mandate.
1991_goh_chok_tong	430	They feel that the mood is right.
1991_goh_chok_tong	431	I feel that the mood isright.
1991_goh_chok_tong	432	I was chosen by my colleagues in Cabinet and in Parliament to be the Prime Minister.
1991_goh_chok_tong	433	I want your endorsement as Prime Minister.
1991_goh_chok_tong	434	When Icall for a general election soon, I hope you will give me that clear mandate.
1991_goh_chok_tong	435	I hope that you will endorse my style of government, my way of doingthings and my programme.
1991_goh_chok_tong	436	Thank you.
1991_goh_chok_tong	437	Goodnight.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1	Tribute to Goh Chok TongFriends and fellow Singaporeans, I've known Mr Goh Chok Tong for a very long time, more than 25 years.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	2	We first met in 1978.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	3	It was not long after he entered politics.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	4	We met socially and I remember he was explaining to me how he was consciously staying away from making speeches on shipping matters because he was from NOL (Neptune Orient Lines) and he wanted to broaden out and talk about other subjects.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	5	Soon after I met him, I went away to the US to study.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	6	When I was away, I needed to make a presentation on Singapore – Know Your World – and wanted something to show the Americans what Singapore was like.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	7	So, I asked Mr Goh and he sent me some slides of activities in Marine Parade, a kite-flying competition, something you won't find in America and it added something to letting the Americans know us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	8	I came back from America after two years in the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	9	He was my minister.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	10	I would brief him regularly.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	11	Then I entered Cabinet and he was a colleague and then, he was the Prime Minister.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	12	When Mr Goh took over from Mr Lee Kuan Yew as PM, many people wondered how he would work out because Singapore had had onlyone PM ever since it was independent, in fact, ever since before it was independent.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	13	What would the new PM be like?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	14	Would he be his own man?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	15	What mark would he put on Singapore?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	16	All this uncertainty was soon dispelled.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	17	Chok Tong established his own style, milder, gentler, consultative and inclusive, but firm and clear.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	18	He built his own team.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	19	He retained key members from his own generation to help with the transition.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	20	He brought in new and younger ministers and he got good men and women to work with him and formed a strong team.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	21	And I'd just like to mention two of the people who kept on and stayed with him.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	22	One is Mr Dhanabalan, who had actually gone into the private sector after the transition was completed and came back in again when I was ill with lymphoma in 1992 and took over from me in MTI (Ministry of Trade and Industry) and looked after MTI for one year, one crucial year, and helped out at a very difficult time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	23	And the other one is Dr Tony Tan, who also went out after the transition into the private sector, but came back in 1995 because Chok Tong asked him to help run Mindef (Ministry of Defence) for two years.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	24	And he stayed for nine years and now, he's staying for another year to help me out with my transition.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	25	So, I owe them a thank you.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	26	Chok Tong launched new policies to take Singapore forward.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	27	Some were popular policies, like Edusave and Medifund.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	28	Everybody liked them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	29	Some were difficult but necessary policies.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	30	We had to cut the CPF (Central Provident Fund), we had to raise the GST (Goods and Services Tax), not popular, but we had to do it and Chok Tong sold these policies and persuaded people to do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	31	Many things were in foreign policy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	32	He travelled, he made friends with foreign leaders, he established contacts, gained their respect and made use of these links for our advantage, for example, establishing many free trade agreements with important trading partners and I should just mention one, the US free trade agreement because that one was born on a golf course.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	33	One evening after dinner, he persuaded Bill Clinton to play golf in Bandar Seri Begawan at night and over 18 holes, a free trade agreement was born.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	34	So, that means he's telling me I should play golf.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	35	Chok Tong established his own connection with Singaporeans, not high-flown oratory, but sincere, direct, personal.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	36	He made people feel comfortable and listened to.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	37	He persuaded people to accept tough decisions.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	38	He explained highly-sensitive issues and defused them and so, when we had dialogues discussing very difficult things, I was always very comfortable sitting next to him because I knew that no matter how difficult the subject, how awkward the question, how uncomfortable the audience, he would be able, with a soft turn of word, with a joke, with a nice question back, to put the audience at ease and get his point across.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	39	And that's why when you see the pictures of me sitting next to him on a dialogue, I'm always smiling.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	40	But following him on the National Day Rally all by myself here, well, that's a different show altogether.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	41	But Chok Tong won the support of voters and the respect and the affection of Singaporeans and brought us all closer together as one people and, for that, I think we all thank Chok Tong.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	42	II Entering politics and becoming PMI owe a personal debt to Goh Chok Tong.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	43	I didn't plan to enter politics or to become PM, but he brought me in.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	44	He guided me and supported me and especially over these last 14 years when I was his Deputy PM (DPM) and since coming in, politics has engaged all my energies and abilities.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	45	It's what they call a 24/7 job, there's no running away from it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	46	I've been part of a team dealing with many issues, big and small, and I've learnt much from the previous two PMs, especially not just to focus on policies but on how the policies impact people, the lives of individual Singaporeans, what does it mean, how does it hurt, where can we help.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	47	So, I've always paid a lot of attention to my MPS cases, my Meet-the-People Session cases.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	48	Nine out of 10 are routine, but always keep my eye open for that last tenth one where the policy has gone wrong, the implementation is not right or maybe the policy is wrong and has to be changed and we have to do something, intervene and put it right.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	49	I won't tell you which ones otherwise you will all come and look for me.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	50	But I have red stickers on my table so when such a case comes, I put a red sticker and I see to it personally.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	51	I've learnt that not all problems can be solved, but some can and must and when you do solve one of these, it really gives you a high and it gives my helpers a high too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	52	It makes my evening worthwhile and then the next time you come back for the MPS, chuffed up, enthused, energised and we try again.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	53	And when you have a long case, well, we sit patiently and we wait.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	54	It's a big step from being DPM to being PM.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	55	It's not just working out policies or managing the economy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	56	It's really uniting all Singaporeans, making sure everybody knows and feels that we are on the same venture together and building our nation and making each generation of Singaporeans feel proud to be Singaporean, proud to carry that pink IC and that red passport wherever we go.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	57	III Singapore at a crossroadIt's a unique challenge leading Singapore now, in 2004, because Singapore is at a crossroad.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	58	It's a different world out there.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	59	It's a post-Cold War world.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	60	What does that mean?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	61	It means there's one hyperpower, the United States.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	62	There's no two superpowers, it's not a multipolar world, it's one hyperpower.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	63	China is rising, India is opening up, Southeast Asia is also growing in transition, but reasonably optimistic overall.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	64	And one major reality out there is the war on terrorism which is going to continue for a long time to come.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	65	In Singapore, this is not just a change of the PMs.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	66	It's a generational change to the post-independence generation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	67	It's a different generation of Singaporeans, different from the group which fought for independence, different from the group who grew up with independence in the immediate post-independence years who experienced the transformation, saw how Singapore changed, saw the effort and the passion which went into building Singapore, which went into achieving what we have and wanted to pick up and run and carry on with the job.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	68	Now, it's a new generation and it's got to take Singapore another step forward, another level higher.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	69	IV A fresh, bold approachTo do that, we need a fresh and bold approach.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	70	We've been successful, wildly successful.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	71	Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting here today.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	72	But we can't stand still because the world is changing, our people are changing and so must Singapore and so must the way we govern Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	73	To succeed, we have to balance between continuity and change, keeping what is still working and good and strong in our system, which is a lot, and changing the part which is obsolete, discarding the part which is no longer relevant, inventing new pieces, new ideas to deal with new problems and to take advantage of new opportunities and to develop new strengths and strategies to thrive in a different world.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	74	We can never afford to be satisfied with the status quo, even if we are still okay, even if our policies are still working.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	75	People say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	76	I say, if it ain't broke, better maintain it, lubricate it, inspect it, replace it, upgrade it, try something better and make it work better than before.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	77	I was a member of Chok Tong's team and I contributed to many of Chok Tong's policies.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	78	These are sound policies, but we must always be prepared to look at them again, we must never be trapped by what we have and we must update them and conceive new ideas to go ahead.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	79	And this is true not just of the government but also of Singapore, also of society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	80	The Ministry of Education recently did a survey of CEOs and employers.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	81	They wanted to know how the employers looked at the output from our schools, looked at the young generation of people who are coming out from school, universities, working, what are their strengths and weaknesses.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	82	And they made many observations, but it boiled down basically to one key point which I think we know at the bottom of our hearts, sometimes we don't articulate it, and it is this – we are so capable, we are so efficient, we are so comfortable that we stick with what we have tried and tested and found working and we are reluctant to take risks and try new things.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	83	And that is a weakness.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	84	It's a weakness which we have to overcome.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	85	The key to overcoming this is a mindset change.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	86	We have to see opportunities rather than challenges in new situations, we have to be less conventional, we must be prepared to venture and you've got to do this as individuals, we've got to do this as a government and I think we have to do it as a society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	87	Let me give you some examples of what I mean.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	88	As individuals, let me give you a personal example because this is something which is true of all of us and me, too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	89	One day recently, I was coming back to Singapore Changi Airport, Arrival Hall, immigration counters.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	90	The security officer said, "Walk through".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	91	I said, "No, let me queue up and see what it's like".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	92	So, I came in.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	93	There are about eight counters, right? "
2004_lee_hsien_loong	94	All Passports", "All Passports", "All Passports", "All Passports".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	95	The last two say "Singapore Passports Only".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	96	What shall I do?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	97	The "All Passports" counters were all empty.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	98	The "Singapore Passport" counters had a long queue.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	99	So, I looked at this -- this doesn't make sense.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	100	Why is everybody doing that?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	101	They should go across.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	102	Then, I thought of it more, I thought maybe, they know something I don't.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	103	So, I joined them at the "Singapore Passports" counter.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	104	I stood there for 30 seconds.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	105	I said, "This doesn't make sense", went across, sailed through.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	106	The girls smiled at me, beamed, offered me a sweet.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	107	So, I think the pressure to conform, to go with what we're comfortable with -- he's doing it, let's do the same -- it happens to all of us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	108	I think it's something we have to combat.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	109	Nobody is there, let's go there first, see what happens.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	110	So, that's on the individual level.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	111	I am sure you have examples, but I will just stick to myself today.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	112	As a government, we have to rethink all our problems, big and small.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	113	Nothing should ever be set in stone.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	114	We've made big changes recently.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	115	The GST changes is a big one.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	116	The CPF cut was a big one and now, we are working on wage reform.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	117	That's another big one which will take some time and this will have a significant impact on our future.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	118	So, we've got to change our policies or look at our policies.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	119	We've got to support entrepreneurs.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	120	We've got to support Singaporeans being spontaneous, being unconventional.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	121	We should not put obstacles in their way.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	122	We should help them to succeed.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	123	Let me give you one example.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	124	These are the Duck and Hippo Tours.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	125	You know what's a Duck Tour?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	126	It's a boat with wheels where you take a ride, you go into the harbour, you sail around, you come back.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	127	The Duck took two years to get a licence -- nearly died.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	128	Very difficult because they went to the LTA (Land Transport Authority).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	129	LTA says, "Your duck has a propeller, how can it be a car?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	130	" They went to the MPA (Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	131	MPA says, "Your duck has wheels!"
2004_lee_hsien_loong	132	So, ding-dong, it took two years.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	133	Eventually, we sorted the problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	134	The Duck became a success.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	135	So, came the Hippo.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	136	The Hippo is a bus with no top, okay?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	137	So, you sit on top, you drive around.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	138	It's just like in London or one of the other Western cities.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	139	Question -- Is the Hippo a bus?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	140	A very important question because if it is not a bus, it is not allowed to stop at a bus-stop.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	141	So, that one we did better.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	142	Six months, we solved the problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	143	I think we have to do better than that.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	144	We also need, as a government, to encourage participation and debate.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	145	We have opened up over the years.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	146	We've got the Speakers' Corner.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	147	We've allowed a lot more discussion.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	148	If you read the newspapers, what the newspapers write, the columnists, the Forum Page writers, the degree of debate is much more than we used to have, or in Parliament.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	149	But I think we can go further.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	150	So, there are two things we are going to do.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	151	One, for indoor talks, we are going to do away with licensing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	152	Right now, if you are going outdoors or indoors, if you want to do a talk, you need a Public Entertainment licence.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	153	Usually, it's approved, it's not a problem, but once in a while, you are slow or the police have reservations, they say, "No", but it's very rare.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	154	So now, we've decided we are going to exempt indoor talks from licensing requirements unless they touch on sensitive issues like race and religion.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	155	The second thing we're going to do is to open up the Speakers' Corner where you can go and make any speech you like
2004_lee_hsien_loong	156	and we are going to say, "Well, if you want to go there and have an exhibition, go ahead".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	157	Once in a while, Think Centre says they want to go to the Speakers' Corner and they want to plant 100 flowers there, let the 100 flowers bloom.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	158	Well, I think go ahead.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	159	They want to water the flowers, go ahead.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	160	They want to turn the flowers down, go ahead.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	161	I mean, free expression as long as you don't get into race and religion and don't start a riot.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	162	It's a signal – speak, speak your voice, be heard, take responsibility for your views and opinions.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	163	As a society also, we have to be forward-looking.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	164	I asked some young people what they would like me to say tonight and one of them said this – "Be forward-looking.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	165	Don't let elders deter you by saying it cannot be done or scare you with war stories".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	166	Maybe, I was telling him war stories because I know him.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	167	I agree that you shouldn't be scared by your elders, but I think you should listen to them, think carefully what their lessons mean in this new day and age and then use those lessons to avoid unnecessary mistakes and solve problems our way today.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	168	But we have to be prepared to accept the diversity of views and to listen to the debate and to have this discussion, always with a view to moving Singaporeforward.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	169	Let me give a controversial example.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	170	It's quite a controversial one.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	171	Some people told me, "Don't raise it, it’s your first rally speech, very dangerous", but I'm going to do it anyway.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	172	It's to do with the casino.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	173	We've said, "No'' to the casino for a very long time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	174	I've said "No" to the casino for a very long time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	175	In 1985, we had a recession.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	176	I remember the late Mr Teh Cheang Wan wanted the casino, argued for it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	177	We said, "No".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	178	We didn't proceed.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	179	This time round, we had the ERC (Economic Review Committee).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	180	The Subcommittee has put up the proposal for a casino.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	181	On the ERC, I said, "No", a majority of the members said, "No".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	182	We didn't recommend it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	183	But the subject didn't die and we have to reconsider because the argument comes up, the situation changes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	184	Why is the situation different?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	185	Because there are "cruises to nowhere", more and more cruises to nowhere.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	186	Some don't even cruise, some anchor nowhere.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	187	You can go to Batam.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	188	I'm told there are 13 down there.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	189	I haven't been there, but Wong Kan Seng has been.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	190	He told me it was by accident, and Singaporeans go there.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	191	So, Singaporeans are already doing this, right?Then you want tourists.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	192	There are millions of tourists because the Indians have money to spend, the Chinese have money to spend.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	193	Every tour group to Singapore goes to Genting.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	194	Macau is opening up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	195	Now, they have broken the monopoly, new operators, more shows, more games.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	196	If we want to grow our tourism traffic and double the number of tourists to Singapore, we don't just want them to come here because of gambling, but if gambling is one of the things they want to do, then maybe we should allow them to do that in Singapore, find some way to do that and if, as a result of that, I get, over 10 years, double the traffic volume, I think we should think about it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	197	So, MTI has come with a new proposal, not just a casino, but an integrated resort, entertainment centre.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	198	So, you have shows, you have family entertainment, you have food, restaurants, art, all sorts of things and in the middle, of course, you also have this place.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	199	Should we say, "No"?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	200	Well, I think we should take a deep breath and think about it carefully.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	201	I know many Singaporeans have expressed concerns and very strong concerns and the religious groups particularly have very strong views and their objections are not irrelevant.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	202	They are valid objections.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	203	It's because of these objections that for so long, we haven't done this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	204	But I think we shouldn't just say, "No".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	205	I think we should consider -¬ can we have the casino and still contain the social problems?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	206	Let's study it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	207	Let's see if there's some way to do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	208	So, I think what we are going to do is to request for proposals.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	209	Let's put out to say we are going to impose the following restrictions: Singaporeans below a certain income, you don't go.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	210	I mean, if they want to travel all the way to Batam, that's them, but we will not make it easy for people to go broke and ruin their families in Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	211	But if a millionaire wants to bring another millionaire friend from China or India, I don't think I should say "no" to him.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	212	It may help lessen my other taxes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	213	So, I think we will find a reasonable restriction, draw a line, call for the proposals, test the market.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	214	Let's see what proposals come in.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	215	If it makes sense and people think that this is worth doing commercially, we make a judgment, we proceed.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	216	If it's not worth it, not worth the downside risks, then we will call it off.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	217	We will consider all views before deciding.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	218	Finally, if we decide against it, then I think we will have had a valuable debate in our society, a valuable discussion and sent a strong signal that we are prepared to discuss all sorts of things and reopen long-settled issues.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	219	But if we decide to proceed, then the final solution which we implement will have to address the valid concerns which Singaporeans have raised.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	220	So, it's not black and white.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	221	I mean, it's looking for an appropriate middle way where we can have our cake and also eat most of it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	222	Increasingly, the world is going to be like that.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	223	China opened up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	224	Deng Xiaoping said, "When you open the windows, the flies will fly in".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	225	So, you can't close the windows, you'll just have to have a fly-swatter, a fly-trap, have one of these UV lights to zap them, but keep the windows open and keep your interior as clean and as hygienic for your own people as possible.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	226	And I think that's the attitude we should have.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	227	V What are our priorities?So, with such a framework, with such an approach to our problems, what are our priorities?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	228	There are many, but tonight, I would like to list just five of them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	229	Firstly, external relations, making friends with other countries and protecting our interests overseas.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	230	Secondly, building the economy, creating jobs, helping wages and incomes to go up, pressing on with upgrading, looking after those who are affected by this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	231	Thirdly, engaging the new generation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	232	Fourthly, educating, investing in our young so that they are not just learning to make a living for themselves but also developing their character and their emotional roots in Singapore and discovering their strengths and achieving their potential; not just for a few, but for every child and also to get them to learn their mother tongues.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	233	And the fifth one, I put it last, but I'm sure you won't forget it, has to do with more babies.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	234	But let me start with external relations even though I think for many Singaporeans, the economy is at the top of your minds.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	235	VI External relationsOne thing which isn't going to change is our approach to external relations.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	236	We seek to be friends with all countries, and especially with our immediate neighbours and the major powers.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	237	We pursue win-win co-operation with all countries who are willing to co-operate with Singapore, but that doesn't mean that we can always accommodate the views or the positions of other countries.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	238	When our vital interests are at stake, we must quietly stand our ground.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	239	As Dr Habibie said, I'm sure you’ll remember, Singapore is a little red dot.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	240	If we don't defend our interests, who will?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	241	This approach has earned us respect internationally and a network of good relations with many countries around the world.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	242	From time to time, we are put to the test.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	243	As a small country, we can't afford to flinch.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	244	When Michael Fay was sentenced to caning for vandalism, Bill Clinton as President wrote to our President on his behalf.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	245	But we couldn't remit his sentence of caning.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	246	All we could do is to reduce two strokes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	247	From six, we went to four.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	248	If this were a Chinese punishment, wu shi da ban (fifty floggings with the stick) would become si shi wu da ban (45 floggings).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	249	And people in Asia noted our stand.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	250	When PM Mahathir of Malaysia pressured us to change the water agreements, we stood firmly by our legal rights.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	251	We gave a full public explanation of the negotiations with Malaysia – why we were justified in international law and we were prepared to go to any international tribunal.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	252	But we still do our best to maintain good relations with the US and with Malaysia and, in fact, our relations with these two countries, I think, are good.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	253	Our closest neighbours are Indonesia and Malaysia.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	254	They will always be of special importance to us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	255	Indonesia is holding its second round of the presidential elections soon.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	256	Malaysia has a new PM.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	257	I've known PM Abdullah Badawi for many years already and under him, our relations have taken a fresh start and I look forward to working with PM Abdullah Badawi to strengthen our bilateral relations further.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	258	I was very grateful that after I was sworn in, the next day he gave me a call to congratulate me and to wish me well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	259	So, I said I look forward to working with him.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	260	We have broad relations with China for many years since the visit of Deng Xiaoping to Singapore – he was then the Vice-Premier – in 1978.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	261	And we want to deepen these relations for the future.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	262	Unfortunately, our ties with China are currently under some strain after the Chinese reaction to my recent visit to Taiwan.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	263	I've seen letters to the press – Straits Times, also Zaobao, also Berita Harian – which show they understand the Government's position and I am grateful for the support they've shown the Government.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	264	But nevertheless, tonight, let me explain why I needed to visit Taiwan, why Singapore is not changing its one-China policy and why I've become more worried about the cross-straits situation after my visit.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	265	Why did I visit Taiwan?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	266	Because the cross-straits situation is the most serious security problem in the region, the most dangerous problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	267	Economically, China and Taiwan are getting closer together.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	268	They say half-a-million Taiwanese work in China, but politically, the two are drifting apart.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	269	China has made it very clear that if Taiwan moves towards independence, China is not going to stand idly by and war may be inevitable.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	270	In this current, very tense situation, I will have to make some very difficult judgment calls as PM.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	271	I wanted to understand the thinking of my friends and contacts in Taiwan.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	272	Some of them are now key leaders on both sides, on the Pan-Green side and on the Pan-Blue side.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	273	I needed to sense the shifts in the tone and texture of Taiwanese society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	274	Only then can I make an objective assessment with conviction and knowledge.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	275	You've got to talk to people, feel them, sense their mood, their body language, the atmosphere in the society
2004_lee_hsien_loong	276	and I can't get this feel just by sitting in my office surfing the Internet, reading reports, even secret reports, or watching CNN or CNA.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	277	It’s not possible.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	278	You have to be there.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	279	If other countries are going to take Singapore's views and assessments of the cross-straits situation seriously, then they've got to view us as informed, impartial and balanced.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	280	If Singapore can help in some way to prevent miscalculations by some key players, then we are going to do our utmost to do so.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	281	We are small, we are not influencing the events, but we can provide some inputs to help the key players avoid mistakes and misjudgments.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	282	Why did I go in July?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	283	Because Chok Tong had told me that the handover would be in August and so, July was the only window for me to go before becoming PM.The Chinese have protested that my visit to Taiwan was contrary to Singapore's one-China policy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	284	But Singapore has always observed the one-China policy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	285	We took this position right from our independence in 1965.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	286	In 1971, we voted for PRC's admission into the UN to take its UN seat.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	287	In October 1990, we established diplomatic relations with China.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	288	By then, China understood Singapore's position on Taiwan, that historically, we have unique and important interests there which continue to be vital to our security today.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	289	Two years after we established diplomatic relations with China, I visited Taiwan in 1992.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	290	I was then already DPM.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	291	So, my recent visit toTaiwan is not my first one under these circumstances, it's my second one, and it doesn't contradict our one-China policy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	292	Nor can it be seen as emboldening Taiwan independence elements.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	293	This makes no sense because the Taiwanese know too well that we stand for one China and are opposed to Taiwan independence.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	294	Indeed, we are very worried by the growth of Taiwan independence forces.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	295	Singapore's one-China policy will not change.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	296	A move by Taiwan towards independence is neither in Singapore's interests nor in the region's interests.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	297	If Taiwan goes for independence, Singapore will not recognise it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	298	In fact, no Asian country is going to recognise it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	299	Nor will the European countries.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	300	China will fight.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	301	Win or lose, Taiwan will be devastated.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	302	Unfortunately, I met only very few Taiwanese leaders who recognised t, his reality.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	303	The problem is that it's not going to be just Taiwan which is going to be damaged.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	304	It will be a grave setback for the whole region.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	305	Our hope for China to emerge peacefully and for the region to prosper through investments and trade and tourism will be shattered.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	306	In any case, I think it would be the height of absurdity for Singapore to want to quarrel with China over the question of Taiwan because the cross-straits issue is not a permanent problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	307	It will be resolved sooner or later – either sooner if matters come to a head when Taiwan amends its Constitution, or later, eventually, if the situation evolves peacefully over two or three decades, China continues to grow and Taiwan's economy is progressively integrated into China's economy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	308	The process is inexorable; there can be no other final outcome.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	309	I came back from Taiwan more troubled than before I went because the ruling party, the DPP, is preoccupied with domestic politics.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	310	Their immediate priority is the upcoming Legislative Yuan elections –立法院选举 – at the end of the year and they're going to go all out to have the Pan-Green parties win an absolute majority.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	311	On the KMT side, they're also preoccupied with domestic policies, with the shooting incident on March 19 when somebody tried to assassinate President Chen Shui-bian and also with the recounting of the last presidential election votes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	312	So, neither side has had time to think about Taiwan's future, about the longer term, how to manage relations with China, how best to reconcile the aspirations of the Taiwanese people with the realities of their international position.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	313	There is a stronger Taiwanese identity emerging.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	314	More people are speaking in the Taiwanese dialect, what they call 河洛语 is a Taiwanese form of Hokkien.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	315	Before Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian became President, most Taiwanese people considered themselves as Chinese.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	316	Now, many think of themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	317	Somebody told me they did a poll.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	318	You have a choice – are you Taiwanese, are you Taiwanese/Chinese, or are you Chinese?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	319	And a majority said, "I am not Chinese, I am not Taiwanese/Chinese, I'm Taiwanese".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	320	And the Green leaders, some of them tell me that they believe that a majority of the people of Taiwan support an independent Taiwan now, so that the idea of Taidu(Taiwan Independence) has now become a mainstream view in Taiwan society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	321	But the Blue leaders questioned this because they said, "Well, if you say independence is the status quo, yes, people like that.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	322	If you say independence is a declaration of independence, that's a different matter".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	323	But the reality is the Green side believes that the majority is pro-independence
2004_lee_hsien_loong	324	and they may act on it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	325	The Taiwanese media are a freewheeling and parochial lot.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	326	They thrive on juicy news and speculation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	327	They chased me around when I was in Taiwan.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	328	The 代表 (representative) asked me what I wanted to do for breakfast.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	329	I said, in the old days, I used to go to the coffeeshop, to have 豆浆油条 (fritters and soya bean drink).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	330	He says, "No, no, no.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	331	You cannot go for豆浆油条 .
2004_lee_hsien_loong	332	We will bring the 豆浆油条to you because if you go out, you will be surrounded by the paparazzi and you will be more popular than 5566 (the Taiwanese boy band)”.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	333	So, it's a completely different media milieu.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	334	The newspapers cover almost exclusively domestic news, very little or no reporting of the situation in North Korea, of war against terrorism, or of the war in Iraq, or of the US elections.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	335	So, I don't sense, therefore, that the Taiwanese people appreciate the international strategic environment.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	336	They don't understand how preoccupied the US is with the war in Iraq, how much they want to settle North Korea, how interdependent America and China have already become.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	337	Many also don't realise how rapidly China is transforming itself and how major powers in the world are repositioning themselves in response to a rising China.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	338	The problem is made worse because they have a rule that if you are a government officer, a political leader or a civil servant, you cannot visit China.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	339	So, the business people know, but the political leaders and the civil servants who are making policy, they can read the reports, but they have not seen firsthand Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Shenzhen, how China has changed and how Taiwan's position has changed.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	340	Many Taiwanese believe that China will not use force on Taiwan even if it moves towards independence.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	341	They are wrong.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	342	I visited China in May.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	343	I met the top leaders.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	344	The cross-straits issue was at the top of their agenda and China is absolutely serious.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	345	For China, the 2008 Olympics is a small matter, but preventing Taiwanese independence is crucial to China.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	346	The Taiwanese press, amongst other misreportings, speculated that I had visited Taiwan in order to play a mediator's role between Chinaand Taiwan.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	347	It showed that they didn't understand the situation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	348	It's not just a misreporting, they didn't understand the core situation because I am in no position to play such a role
2004_lee_hsien_loong	349	and I have no desire to do so and the key thing is, they didn't understand that the issue between China and Taiwan is not a misunderstanding which 和事佬 (mediator) can come along and, you know, jolly both sides and resolve, then you shake hands like in Everitt Road.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	350	It's a fundamental and deep contradiction which will require great skill and restraint and wisdom on both sides to resolve and to manage.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	351	Therefore, there is a real risk of miscalculation and mishap.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	352	If war breaks out across the straits, we will be forced to choose between the two sides.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	353	As a friend of both sides, any decision is going to be painful, but if the conflict is provoked by Taiwan, then Singapore cannot support Taiwan.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	354	I will not change our one-China policy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	355	But I had no choice but to make this visit to Taiwan in order to be confident that I can take the right decision for Singapore in a looming crisis.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	356	We value our relations with China.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	357	I have met many senior Chinese leaders, most recently in May, and I deeply appreciated their goodwill and friendship and their warm welcome and their readiness to co-operate with Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	358	This co-operation has always been on the basis of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit – 平等互惠互利 – that's their slogan and that's ours too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	359	If our co-operation is affected, both sides will lose.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	360	I regret that my visit to Taiwan has caused this severe reaction in China which affected relations.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	361	I also regret the way the Taiwanese media chose to play up my private and unofficial visit.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	362	This isn't going to be the last time our relations with a major friendly power are strained.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	363	We strive for good relations with all countries, but from time to time issues are going to arise and big powers have their own interests and will exercise their influence to get their way.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	364	We may be old friends, but when our interests diverge, or even when our approaches to the same problem differ, they have to put their interests first and their approaches first and so must we.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	365	This is a reality of the compelling pressures of international politics and of national interests and we must remember this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	366	VII Restructuring our economyLet me move on to domestic affairs now and talk about restructuring the economy, which I think, for many Singaporeans, is the item at the top of your agenda.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	367	Our economy is doing well because we have been restructuring it, because we have been taking the painful but necessary steps and we have made ourselves competitive and so, this year, we've got 10 per cent growth in the first half and maybe 8 or 9 per cent for the year.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	368	It's because of restructuring, it's not by chance.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	369	The challenge for us is how to continue growing and the answer is, well, we've got to continue to restructure, we've got to continue to upgrade.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	370	It's difficult, it's painful, it's tiring, but it's not just Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	371	It's a worldwide trend because of globalisation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	372	It's happening everywhere.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	373	There is ferocious competition.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	374	The developed countries are facing it, in America, in Europe.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	375	The developing countries are facing it, China andIndia.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	376	We see them as ferocious competitors.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	377	They see other China men and other Indians as ferocious competitors.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	378	So, we are afraid of 1,300 million Chinese, maybe.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	379	They are afraid of 1,299 million Chinese, too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	380	And the competition is ferocious.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	381	So, the result is less job security, more need to adapt as the market changes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	382	And overall, if you look at it in broad trends, I think in the developing countries, where they've upgraded themselves and got their infrastructure right and their rules right and their conditions right, like the coastal cities in China, like some cities in India, I think that their incomes will rise because they are very cheap now.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	383	In the developed countries, in Germany where they have too much social welfare and they can't afford it; in America where their wages are very high and things can be done cheaper overseas, even for programmers, even for skilled workers, even doctors, I think in the developed countries, the incomes are going to fall.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	384	So the bottom is going to come up and the top is going to come down, we are somewhere in between.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	385	What happens to us?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	386	I think we have to try and push our incomes up and to do that, we have to restructure, upgrade, improve our productivity and make our labour markets more flexible so that when the conditions change, when business change, we can also get our companies to alter, to adapt, to get into the new business and get out of the old business so that they can continue to be productive and can continue to make a living for Singaporeans.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	387	So, we talk about wage reform.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	388	It's not just flexible wages, a few more bonuses here and there, the MVC (Monthly Variable Component), but defining goals for the company, setting goals for the workers, rewarding them according to their goals.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	389	It's what people call KPIs, key performance indicators.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	390	So, you have a key performance indicator – how many boxes you move or how many chips you make, how low your defect rate is, getting people motivated to do the right thing so that they will be productive, so that they will align their interests and they can earn a good living.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	391	And that's what we have been trying to do this year – we've had a tripartite taskforce, we had recommendations in January, we've made good progress – hotels, banks, some other sectors have restructured already and other companies should also follow, especially the SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises) who find it more difficult.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	392	And the economy is picking up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	393	In fact, that's a good time to restructure because then you can build up the buffer of the variable bonus.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	394	When the economy is down, the fear is there, but the pain is great.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	395	So, I think do it now.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	396	We also have to raise our productivity, which means retraining workers but also means restructuring the companies and I think we can do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	397	PSA and HDB restructured last year.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	398	PSA particularly had a very difficult exercise, but they've done it and they have done well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	399	They had to drop about 600 workers, they had to slash costs to the bone, they had to retrain their people, cut their prices to their customers so as to lock them in and get them signed on.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	400	But they have turned around.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	401	The volume is up, profits are up, KPIs have been met, bonuses will be paid and the customers say there's a new PSA now because when there's a problem, the PSA staff will go to the company to ask the company, "How can I help you?" rather than wait for the company to come and then say, "Well, sorry, it's your problem, you look after it".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	402	So, PSA has changed and as PSA has done, other companies have to do too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	403	It will not be the last one because many others will be necessary.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	404	SIA is one company which is in this category.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	405	You know all about SIA also.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	406	You've seen what Senior Minister has said, you've seen what SIA unions have said.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	407	We know that the unions are discussing this, negotiating with the company and making good progress, particularly the NTUC affiliates.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	408	But let me just add this – it's not just the LCCs (low cost carriers) which are the problem, it's not just Bangkok Airport which is the problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	409	The problem is that SIA's competitors used to be very poor and are now quite good.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	410	So, SIA's margin used to be very comfortable, but now, it's much less.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	411	If you fly one of the other airlines, you will find that they're not bad at all, but 20 years ago, it was different.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	412	I give you one example again.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	413	I went to China 20 years ago for the first time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	414	In those days, SIA didn't fly, so I flew a Chinese airline,Singapore to Beijing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	415	It's about six hours, quite a long flight.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	416	The service was abysmal.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	417	We got onto the aeroplane about 11 o'clock, and I said, "What are we going to eat for lunch?''
2004_lee_hsien_loong	418	So, I saw these boxes coming onto the aeroplane, little white boxes, paper boxes, and they passed them down the corridor from passenger to passenger.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	419	Each passenger, one, that's your 打包 (takeaways).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	420	Dim sum inside – cold, greasy, salty, unappetising, a few toothpicks, so you can help yourself.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	421	I was sitting in front, First Class.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	422	So, I thought, maybe First Class passenger, they'll give me special treatment.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	423	Let's see what happens.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	424	So, they went all the way down, they reached the First Class.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	425	We got special treatment – we got two boxes each.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	426	That was 20 years ago.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	427	Today, you fly a Chinese airline, the air hostess comes, she serves you wine, she gives you food, here is the menu.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	428	Would you like a newspaper, sir?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	429	The arrival, the temperature is such and such, remember to wear a coat.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	430	Would you like a blanket?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	431	It's different.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	432	So, SIA's competition is different and SIA knows this and I hope their executives go and ride other airlines regularly to make sure they know what's happening and I think their workers also should ride other airlines from time to time
2004_lee_hsien_loong	433	and I think that this is a reality which SIA and its unions have to confront together and to deal with.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	434	And they will do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	435	And so will other companies.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	436	And I think the Civil Service also has to do it because if the Civil Service is the only place where you have an iron rice bowl, we’ll have a problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	437	Then we'll have more Duck and Hippo stories.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	438	So, we've got to continue running the marathon.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	439	I know that some Singaporeans worry that new PM, maybe very fierce and may push Singaporeans to run even faster.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	440	Let me be quite candid with you.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	441	I can't promise you air-con coaches to ride you there in comfort.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	442	Not possible, but I think we can provide everybody with good shoes, good coaching, running shoes, drink of water and we'll have first aid points along the way, so you can rest and even for those with wheelchairs, we'll bring them along and we will run together as a team and we will get to the ending point together.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	443	But remember, finally, it's not the shoes, it's not the drinks, it's the runner.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	444	You've watched Home Run, right?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	445	I watched it a couple of nights ago, taking a break from writing this speech.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	446	You watch the race – Ah Kun, he had lousy shoes, tattered and torn, shared with his sister.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	447	It disappeared half-way down the race, but he won because he wanted to win
2004_lee_hsien_loong	448	and I think it's that spirit, that determination, that guts which we've got to have if we are going to want to run and win.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	449	I understand what restructuring means for companies and for workers and for the unions and for the families.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	450	Retrenchment is a very emotional experience for everybody – for the workers, for the IROs (industrial relations officers), for the employers, for the human resource people.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	451	In PSA's retrenchment exercise, everybody was involved.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	452	It was a wrenching experience, I think everybody wept.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	453	Even the management wept because they've never had to do this before but at the end of it, it was done.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	454	I think it was done well and the union leaders and the IROs were given PBMs and BBMs in this year's National Day for their blood, sweat and tears.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	455	We salute them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	456	Other cases are less wrenching.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	457	We have more time to prepare.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	458	I think it's less of a shock to the workers.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	459	We can get them prepared psychologically.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	460	We can have those more willing to go arranged to leave earlier, but even then, many families are affected and even those with jobs are worried and unsettled because, they say “will I be next?”
2004_lee_hsien_loong	461	So, we will do our best to support and to help those who are affected because we have to look after them, not only when they lose a job but to help them to find a new one, especially the older workers.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	462	And that means we need retraining programmes and we need to restructure and redesign jobs so that workers will be able to do these new jobs.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	463	The programmes are there.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	464	We have many retraining programmes, but the workers have to make an effort because if they don't make an effort, it's going to be difficult for them to do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	465	I recently watched a video Othman Harun showed me made by Mendaki and WDA (Workforce Development Agency) to encourage workers to change jobs because you can make any number of speeches until your throat gets hoarse, but you need real-life examples of people who have made this transition, who have learnt new skills, who have been able to cross over.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	466	So, this was an effort by Mendaki in Malay and it was called "Kalau Hendak, Seribu Daya".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	467	I thought it was a good movie, just 10, 15 minutes and it showed four stories, but one particularly struck me.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	468	It was a widow, Madam Hafidah Maaruf.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	469	She had five children she was looking after, the eldest doing 'O' levels.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	470	She was a cook when she got retrenched.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	471	Then she attended a reflexologist/masseuse course.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	472	Very tough, but she persevered and she completed the course with her children's help and she set up business in a fitness centre.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	473	I'll just quote what she said in Malay: "Mula saya merasa takut juga, pasal apa saya bukan dari aliran Inggeris atau Melayu, saya dari sekolah Arab, saya tak begitu faham.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	474	Adalah juga masalah masalah yang saya hadapi.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	475	Apabila saya pulang ke rumah guru guru saya adalah anak anak saya.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	476	"In other words, "at first I felt afraid, because I was not from the English or the Malay stream, I was from the Arabic stream, which means a madrasah.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	477	So, I met many difficulties, but when I went home, my teachers were my children".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	478	So, she had the guts to make the transition and to change over and become a reflexologist.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	479	It's not easy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	480	Her business is not doing very, very well, but I wish her well
2004_lee_hsien_loong	481	and I think with her spirit, she will be able to make it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	482	The other thing we have to do to help the retrenched workers and people who lose their jobs is job redesign because there are jobs at the bottom, but they are not attractive.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	483	They are dirty, they are sweaty, they are tiring, unpleasant
2004_lee_hsien_loong	484	but if we can restructure them, I think we can make them more attractive to Singaporeans, pay better, make more sense for Singaporeans to do.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	485	Lim
2004_lee_hsien_loong	486	Swee Say has been doing this in ENV (Ministry of Environment) and now, he's gone back to NTUC.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	487	I think this is going to be one of the key things on his plate.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	488	So, he explained to me, he says, at hawker centres, the hawker assistant picks up the plates and washes them, he’s usually in a pair of slippers, dirty singlet, torn shorts.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	489	He takes the thing, he takes a dirty pail of water, sloshes it around, declares it a clean plate.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	490	So, now, he's organised them, there’re proper uniforms, proper hot water machines to clean the plates, pride of work, proper standards and hygiene, better pay.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	491	And the hawkers who get better service are willing to pay for this to get their plates and dishes washed.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	492	It makes sense.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	493	So, he says 1,000 x 1,000, 1,000 jobs for S$1,000 per job, let's create these 1,000 jobs for a start, 1,000 by 1,000.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	494	He's got about 500 or 600.I asked him, what other examples?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	495	He says, well, town councils.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	496	Town council cleaners are paid very poorly.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	497	Very often, you see foreign workers, sometimes illegally employed by the subcontractor, cheap, but the job is quick and dirty and they finish by 10 o'clock in the morning.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	498	So, because they finish by 10 o'clock in the morning by contract, you only have three or four hours in the morning to clean the floor.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	499	Therefore, you can only clean very few number of flats every day.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	500	Therefore, the wages are poor, S$600.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	501	Why do you want to stop at ten o'clock in the morning?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	502	The town councils say, this way, when the residents come out, the place looks clean.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	503	So, he says, why not stop by two o'clock in the afternoon?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	504	So, when the residents come out, they see people cleaning it and they feel happy it's being cleaned.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	505	But anyway, if you do it at two o'clock in the afternoon, you have a longer period, you can do more work, you can clean more, you can be paid more and you can get more Singaporeans to do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	506	So, I think these are practical ways we can do things in cleaning.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	507	In other industries, too, I think we should pay some attention to this so as to help the workers at the bottom who are out of work find work.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	508	We have foreign workers, yes, they are a great help to our economy and we need them, but we also have to help to restructure our jobs so that Singaporeans can do them, and will do them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	509	Besides jobs, one of the things Singaporeans worry about is the cost of living.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	510	A lot of people worry about the cost of living going up and, indeed, some prices have gone up – electricity, you know, because of oil prices.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	511	S&C charges have gone up because we haven't revised them for more than 10 years and we have to raise charges if we are going to maintain standards and clean the estates properly.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	512	Even prices of chickens and eggs have gone up recently.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	513	I think these can't be helped, but overall, our prices have been stable, yet many people still worry about it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	514	So, I think we have to understand this worry and see what we can do about it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	515	I think for most Singaporeans, the reason why they feel cost of living is up is because wages have come down, bonuses have shrunk and so, belts have been tightened and for everyone, a little bit of an increase hurts.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	516	And they are committed because they plan on a house of a certain size, they have obligations, they have old folks to look after, children to send to schools and so on.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	517	Also, to be quite frank, expectations have gone up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	518	In the old days, very few people had aircons.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	519	Today, when people come to me with an electricity bill problem in Meet-the-People Sessions, I ask them, "Do you turn on your aircon?"
2004_lee_hsien_loong	520	He says, "Only for a short while at night".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	521	I'm sure if I do a show of hands tonight, there'll be many aircons in this room.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	522	And handphones, too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	523	People come to see us with financial problems.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	524	They need the handphone, they feel they must have it and I can understand these are conveniences and comfort items which people want, but you have to realise that they do cost something and that's part of the reason why you feel that money is tight.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	525	So, that's one reason why people feel the cost of living is up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	526	The other groups, of course, are the low-income groups and they have difficulties because for them every increase, however small, is an unwelcome one and we've got various financial assistance schemes and programmes to help them, to help them tide over and to help them find jobs.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	527	But I think there are some concrete things which we can also do to help them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	528	I'll just give you one small example.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	529	I've seen so many, people come and say "electricity cut off" because it's been dragged – promise to pay, promise to pay, promise to pay, then finally cut off.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	530	So they come to us for help.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	531	I say, "What are you going to do?"
2004_lee_hsien_loong	532	He says, "I'll pay instalments".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	533	So I write “they will pay instalments”.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	534	After two instalments, stop, cut off again.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	535	It's not a solution.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	536	So, I told MTI and SingPower, “how about going for pay-as-you-use; cashcard?”
2004_lee_hsien_loong	537	Then I don't have to cut off, you pay back part of the old account and as you use you pay.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	538	Your children need to study, you have medicines to look after you, you can afford to use the electricity because you are paying as you go along and I solve your problem and you avoid my problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	539	So, I think SingPower is going to do that.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	540	I think it will be of some help, but still, we will have to work with these families to help them get their lives back on track.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	541	So, cost of living is a problem, but really, the long-term solution for the cost of living problem is growth because with growth, you have incomes, you have jobs, you have better standards of living and you can meet your obligations.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	542	Medical cost is the other element of cost which people worry about.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	543	Many Singaporeans worry.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	544	On the ground, you can feel it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	545	They tell you, "we dare not get sick".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	546	Actually, most people don't have a problem but some people might have a problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	547	If the bills are big, everybody is scared.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	548	So, I think we have to do something about this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	549	We have Medisave, it's a good scheme.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	550	We have MediShield, which gives you insurance, which helps but is not adequate and needs to be revamped and Khaw Boon Wan's principal job is to work on this and try and see what we can do to update the MediShield system to make it work better for Singaporeans.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	551	You have to pay more premiums, it cannot be helped, but we will be able to come up with a better scheme which will give you better protection and which will look after you in case of ill-health and will save you a lot of worry.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	552	VIII
2004_lee_hsien_loong	553	Older SingaporeansLast week, in my swearing-in speech, I talked about the young generation, the new generation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	554	Unfortunately, as a result of talking about the young generation, I have caused the older Singaporeans and even some not-so-old ones to feel left out.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	555	So, one MP emailed me.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	556	I'll read just a little bit from his email.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	557	He says, "The focus appears to be on youth and vitality for your new term, but I wish to point out that there's a large representation of Singaporeans in the 45 to 60 age group whom we must continue to engage and attend to.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	558	This group has suffered and borne the brunt of the downturn, mostly in stolid silence.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	559	They need to be nursed to regain their self-confidence and pride".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	560	He's right, but let me say I haven't forgotten because I'm in this group.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	561	I know what the concerns of the older Singaporeans are – it’s job security.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	562	We’ve talked about it just now.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	563	Medical costs, we talked about it just now too, but the old folks are particularly worried because it affects them more directly.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	564	Financial security in old age.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	565	Will their CPF be enough?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	566	And also an elder-friendly living environment.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	567	What does that mean?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	568	It means LUP – lift upgrading – it's the most popular of all our upgrading programmes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	569	Never mind the fancy roof, never mind the fountains, never mind the covered walkways, well, covered walkways, we still want, but lifts first because when you are old, when you have to climb the stairs, when you have somebody in a wheelchair, if you are not on a lift landing, you have a problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	570	And I think we can do something about that and focus on the LUP.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	571	There are other practical things which we must adjust as our population ages.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	572	Boon Heng tells me, lift doors close too quickly because you are walking in and before you can get in, your tongkat (walking stick)gets stuck.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	573	Or traffic lights change too fast for the pedestrians.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	574	These are real problems.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	575	I think as our population ages, we have to adjust and we have to make these adjustments for them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	576	And we also need, besides the physical adjustments, the psychological support networks, the community support networks, the outreach groups, the qigong groups, the mutual help groups in the constituencies, even the mahjong groups – some outlet for the old folks to come down to have friends, to have people to care for them so that they will not be lonely when their children are out at work.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	577	So, we will address these concerns and I should also say that we will continue our asset enhancement policy and distribute surpluses when we have surpluses and when we do, we will give senior citizens more, especially to their Medisave.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	578	It won't be as easy as before because our belts have all been tightened, including the Government's, but when we have something to distribute, we will remember the older Singaporeans more.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	579	I think we owe them and they more than deserve it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	580	IX New
2004_lee_hsien_loong	581	generationFor the future, we have to focus on the post-independence generation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	582	They are different from their parents, they've grown up in different circumstances, they have different points of reference, different expectations, different values, much more exposed to the outside world.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	583	And it's the same all over Asia.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	584	I was in Korea recently and they gave me a definition of youth.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	585	They said, a young man is somebody who can do an SMS with one hand with the phone in his pocket.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	586	And they should know because in Korea, young men like that changed the Government.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	587	They kicked out all the old team and they put in a totally new team with no experience.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	588	But then I came home and found out that the world SMS champion is a 23-year-old Singaporean girl.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	589	But I'm proud and confident of this new generation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	590	I've met some of them in Footprints of a Nation, a TV programme two years ago.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	591	More recently, the younger ministers.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	592	Vivian, Khaw Boon Wan, Eng Hen and company were in i-Contact, a TV series.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	593	I was impressed with them (the young students).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	594	They are not all from the top schools.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	595	They are idealistic, they are articulate, they have high ambitions and they are growing up to be responsible adults on the cusp of adulthood, just the point of no longer being a child, able to think broader, more responsibly, participate and speak up with confidence.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	596	And we are distinguishing ourselves internationally.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	597	We do well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	598	I've noticed recently we won Robocup soccer.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	599	I don't know what it was.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	600	What it is is you programme robots to play football and our robots were smarter than other people's robots, which means our robot programmers were smarter than other people's robot programmers.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	601	We go for choir competitions, we win gold medals and we distinguish ourselves academically too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	602	We have a social conscience.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	603	There are many young groups which are organised and do social work.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	604	Last year, I went to one function organised by Mercy Relief, which I was impressed with.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	605	They were started off by a Malay group, by Perdaus and they have gone beyond being a Malay group to stand on their own as a multiracial, secular group doing international work, 700 young volunteers of all races, students, professionals, organising themselves, raising funds and they're doing humanitarian work for refugees in Cambodia and Afghanistan, and flood victims.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	606	So, I asked them, "Are you going to Iraq?"
2004_lee_hsien_loong	607	They said, "Maybe later on".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	608	But they have the spirit and they have the goal and they will do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	609	And the young people are willing to try different paths.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	610	We have a Sports School.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	611	The response is good.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	612	We are building an Arts School.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	613	We already have NAFA and SIA-LaSalle and they are doing well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	614	They have very good students and they go in for all kinds of courses.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	615	And even fashion design, we have Singaporeans winning prizes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	616	Recently, I was walking along the Esplanade on the waters by the sea and I found young people drawing beautiful pictures on the pavement using chalk.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	617	So, I thought to myself – 15 years ago, we might have caned them, but today, we have MITA or MICA (Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	618	So, I think that we have changed.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	619	Well, there is a spectrum.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	620	Not all are engaged.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	621	I read, I think in Today that they went along Orchard Road and asked who's the PM and some people didn't know.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	622	What to do?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	623	And there are some who have difficult backgrounds and lack opportunities.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	624	But by and large, we have groomed a strong generation ready for the future.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	625	And we have to groom this generation, to give them wings and to give them roots.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	626	We need to give them wings, expose them to the world, build their character, let them set their own goals and choices, let them learn from their own mistakes, let them grow and blossom and be themselves.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	627	Guide them, but don't constrain them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	628	But we also have to give them roots, emotional experiences which will bind them here, playing together with each other, roughing it out, taking challenges together because then, they will create friendships, they will create ties, they will have memories and bonds to their friends and to the places where they made these friends.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	629	So, even with wings, they will fly all over the world but come back and be a Singaporean in Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	630	And so, I renamed MCDS to become MCYS, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, and I appointed Vivian as the Minister.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	631	He is the youngest in the Cabinet and I think that they will be able to spark off something to engage the young people to get them enthused in this project of Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	632	A lot of this has to do with education, which I will talk about later on.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	633	One critical aspect of rooting Singaporeans here is to empower them, to give them a say in their lives, to make them feel that they can make a difference.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	634	If you are in China or in America, you can't do that.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	635	One person out of 1.3 billion, can you change China?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	636	How many can become like Deng Xiaoping?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	637	If you were one person out of nearly 300 million in America, can you become the President and change America?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	638	How many people can go on stage and say, "I am John Kerry, I am reporting for duty"?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	639	But in Singapore, you can and you must.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	640	My generation felt that
2004_lee_hsien_loong	641	and that's why when we went to university, we felt and I felt I had to come home, there was an obligation, I had to serve.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	642	The SAF sent me.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	643	I studied Maths.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	644	After one year, I took the exams.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	645	My tutor met me.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	646	He says, "You must stay on".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	647	I said, "But I have to go home.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	648	I've got an obligation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	649	I've got a bond".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	650	He says, "Forget about the bond.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	651	You must do Maths".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	652	I said, "I can't.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	653	I have to go back.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	654	People depend on me".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	655	In a big country, I can say, "Chuck it!
2004_lee_hsien_loong	656	I am doing Maths.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	657	Somebody else will look after the country".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	658	Three million, you may or may not be in politics, but your contribution does count.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	659	People expect you, they send you, they want you back.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	660	You have to go back and do what is the right thing and you can make a difference.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	661	There is a lot of things to do, a lot you can shape.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	662	I think I persuaded him.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	663	When I came back, I think I made the right decision and many people of my generation did that, too, and we've got to get this new generation to feel the same.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	664	We've got to involve them in the community and in national affairs, to take ownership of the country and of the problems.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	665	Don't ask what the Government is going to do.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	666	I read that some people are asking, now that you want young people to get engaged, what is the Government going to do to get young people engaged?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	667	Actually, we are going to wait.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	668	No, get up, do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	669	Nike says, "Just Do It".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	670	Engage your ideals, your ideas, your energies, build a new generation, build tomorrow's Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	671	Don't wait or depend on the Government.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	672	Find your own leaders, organise your own solutions, move.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	673	Politics is not the only way you can do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	674	There are many ways to contribute.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	675	You can be in community service, you can be in social work, you can be in education, you can be in the arts.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	676	But politics is one way to do it and it's important that enough people come into politics so that we have self-renewal and we have a new leadership team.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	677	Political self-renewal is critical to Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	678	Chok Tong started talent-scouting before he became PM.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	679	That's how I came in, aged 32, one of the youngest, in 1984.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	680	But all the people who came in with me in 1984 were in their 30s – Lee Boon Yang, Yeo Cheow Tong, Wong Kan Seng, Tarmugi, Mah Bow Tan, who contested in Potong Pasir, we were all in our 30s.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	681	We didn't think of ourselves as being particularly young, but I suppose, if you look back now, we are because if you compare it with the people who came in in 2001 when we tried very hard and had a lot of young people, our seven MOS (Minister-of-State) from 2001 – the Seven Samurais, I think we call them – their average age is 43 years old and the youngest one was Vivian, who was then 40.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	682	So, we need to have young people come in in their 30s, then you have time to learn, to develop.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	683	In your 30s, you are not ready to take charge, but you are ready to learn, to absorb and you are young enough to absorb and then in your 40s, you are tested, you've gained the experience and then 50s, you can take charge.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	684	You are energetic but ready to go.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	685	And so, we have an experienced team today.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	686	And I've got to do the same.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	687	I can connect with the young people.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	688	I mean, if I do another Footprints of a Nation, I think I'm okay, or i-Contact.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	689	But the generation after that who are now five and six years old, I think they will need new leaders by the time they become 21.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	690	I met one of these young men recently in a block party in my constituency.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	691	He came up to me.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	692	He says, "我认识你，李显龙" (I recognise you, Lee Hsien Loong).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	693	I was very pleased, obviously, not one of the Orchard Road types.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	694	So, I said, "你怎么知道 ?"
2004_lee_hsien_loong	695	(how do you know?).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	696	He said: ”“电视上，第八波道” (on television, Channel 8).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	697	So, I was very pleased.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	698	You know, future voter, calculating, 2012, 2016.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	699	So, I decided to tease him.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	700	I said,“你搞错了，那个人是我的弟弟 ”.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	701	He mixed it up, that’s my brother.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	702	He says, “是你.”
2004_lee_hsien_loong	703	(no, it’s you).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	704	Why? “白头发”, white hair.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	705	So, by the time he is voting, he is going to look at me and say, “白头发”, I think he wants somebody with a little less white hair.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	706	So, we've got to find the people.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	707	When Mr Lee Kuan Yew became PM, he was 35 years old.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	708	Those were revolutionary times.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	709	When Goh Chok Tong became PM, he was 49.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	710	I became PM, I'm 52.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	711	For the next PM, I think we have to try harder.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	712	So, come forward to serve.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	713	Don't wait to be asked and if you know your friend, somebody whom you think is capable, put his name up, we will take a look at him because Singaporeans are shy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	714	Sometimes, they're afraid, you put yourself forward, "毛遂自荐" -- people may misunderstand that you are offering yourself and perhaps you've got an agenda.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	715	But if you know somebody else who is good, who's doing good work quietly, let us know, we will try him out.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	716	We want you to be part of our team.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	717	We don't mind if you have different views, but you must have some views.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	718	If you have no views, I have a problem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	719	If you have different views, we can talk about it and let's do something about it together.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	720	X EducationThe most important gift that we can give to our young and to prepare for their future is education.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	721	It's not just preparing them for a job, but learning to live a life, learning to deal with the world, learning to be a full person, what in Chinese, they say, "xue zhuo ren" (学做人) and in schools, there are plenty of opportunities to learn to be a person.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	722	Tonight, I will talk about primary and secondary education because that's where all the children go and that's one of the key issues for young parents who are starting families.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	723	Our school system has gone through many improvements over the years.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	724	In fact, some people say too many improvements, too many changes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	725	But we've done many things.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	726	We've got more qualified teachers, we've got independent schools, we've got more autonomous schools, we've got Normal (Technical) stream in the secondary schools.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	727	So, the students aren't just sent out to vocational schools or some place else.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	728	And we've made all these improvements, show results internationally in our achievement tests – Maths, Science, Physics – and the numbers going to post-secondary education and the quality of the people going into the workforce.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	729	But beyond what we have got, I think we cannot just do more of the same because if you just do more of the same, you are just going to get incremental improvements.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	730	You need a qualitative change, a quantum leap to get different sort of education, different sort of results.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	731	And that's why we have been moving to a more flexible and more diverse education system.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	732	We've got integrated programmes in schools, we've got a Sports Schools, art schools, maths and science schools.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	733	We are offering people more choice and we are better able to groom special talents and spot ability all across the spectrum, different kinds of ability.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	734	So, what do we do?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	735	To get a better feel for this, I recently met 10 school principals, five primary schools, five secondary schools, with Tharman.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	736	I spent two hours with them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	737	It was a most educational experience for me because I listened to them, their experiences, what they were doing, what they felt they could do better, what they were proud of and how their children were measuring up or not and what they were worried about
2004_lee_hsien_loong	738	and I think there's a lot we can do to help them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	739	Teachers have a most challenging job because they are not just teaching, marking assignments or running the school day by day.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	740	Those are the routine things.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	741	That, you learn in IE.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	742	But you have to know every student, provide individualised teaching, coaching where needed, and help the pupils to learn beyond the classroom and in life, through interaction.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	743	They call it "experiential learning".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	744	It's a big word, but what does it mean?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	745	It means you have to think of new ways to get them to engage, to do something and, by doing something, to hoist in an indelible experience.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	746	So, I give you two examples.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	747	Tanjong Katong Girls School, TKGS -- they sent their whole Secondary Three cohort to Outward Bound Schoolfor five days, teachers as well as students, conducted classes there.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	748	So, you do the Outward Bound routine, you camp, you rough it out, you do the physical part, test out your character, experience the ruggedness and so, challenge each other and put their leadership skills to the test.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	749	Education Ministry can't order this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	750	The schools must want to do this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	751	Another school, Hougang Primary, they said children come from working-class households, may not have opportunities at home.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	752	The principal went round and bought a few old discarded pianos and put them around the school compound in the school premises, so that some of the children can play, and some of them can listen to the playing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	753	And so, they also have access to music.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	754	I think it shows initiative
2004_lee_hsien_loong	755	and it's not just the principals showing initiative.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	756	You really want the teachers and the students also to show initiative.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	757	Shuqun, another secondary school, I think, from quite a tough neighbourhood.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	758	They've got students who came to see the principal because they said nearby, there is a video arcade.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	759	The students go there, mix with bad company.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	760	"Why don't you give me an empty classroom, buy me one Xbox and one Playstation and I will organise a good video arcade inside the school?"
2004_lee_hsien_loong	761	So, the principal said, "Are you sure?"
2004_lee_hsien_loong	762	He says,"Ya, we will take charge.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	763	" But you need somebody to be there to make sure that children in the video arcade aren't doing wrong things in school.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	764	So, they organised the parents to be chaperones, to sit in and oversee and so, they have a video arcade going and they got a system.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	765	If people want to bring in a game, somebody will vet the game to make sure it's not X-rated
2004_lee_hsien_loong	766	and then they can play the game in this safe environment, in their video arcade.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	767	They may not be top students, but they are students with initiative.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	768	And so, we have to help not just the students in the top end in the schools where they are bright but also across the spectrum because we've got to get the weaker students to believe in themselves, to show them how they can achieve, to set targets for themselves which are realistic and map out ways for them to succeed which fit their abilities and aptitudes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	769	Every student has his strength and he can accomplish something.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	770	If you can identify it, he can do something.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	771	Last year, Wanbao told the story of one student – during Sars, he got HQO, father was in Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	772	Father got HQO, son got HQO, Home Quarantine Order, spent 10 days at home, Normal (Technical) student.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	773	What did he do?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	774	He had learnt Excel Spreadsheet in school.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	775	So, in 10 days, he computerised his father's chicken stall accounts.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	776	It's quite something.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	777	So, Normal (Technical) doesn't mean "bodoh"(stupid).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	778	I mean, these are kids with something in their aptitude if you can unlock it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	779	Naval Base Secondary School, they also have students from a wide spectrum.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	780	They have Normal (Academic) students, some of them doing art.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	781	The school organised for them to raise funds to go on a field trip, 20 students to Paris.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	782	So, they made artworks, they sold their artworks, they raised their funds and they competed to go on the trip.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	783	One of the things they have to do is to stop smoking because good behaviour is needed.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	784	They go to the principal and say, "I stopped smoking one month.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	785	Can I go to Paris?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	786	" They raised enough, they went.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	787	It's a life-transforming experience for them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	788	They came back with tremendous pride.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	789	So, one says to the other, "I saw a Picasso.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	790	Did you?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	791	" I haven't seen a Picasso.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	792	And they did well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	793	At the end, they all passed their art.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	794	One third got distinctions.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	795	So, there are many things like this which you can do, through interaction, through activities.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	796	By working together, you build character, team spirit, leadership and you give hope and you put people onto the right path.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	797	It's much better than formal education because education is about every experience in school and not just a classroom.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	798	I came away from the two hours I spent with the principals very encouraged by their vision, by their drive, by their ideas and their idealism.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	799	I think that a good, dedicated set of principals and staff is the critical X-factor if we want our schools to improve, the key to quality and diversity.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	800	It's not theories, it's not principles, it's not just the edicts you put out from the Ministry of Education.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	801	It's the people in the schools.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	802	Who are they?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	803	Are they committed to this?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	804	Will they do it or not?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	805	And I think we have a dedicated group of teachers and principals and quite a few outstanding ones.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	806	And if we can get more of them, more good people, then, of course, our schools can be even better.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	807	So, we've got to give the schools more resources and more teachers and then, they can make this qualitative leap.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	808	And we are going to do that.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	809	It will take time, but we will get additional teachers – 1,000 more for the primary schools, 1,400 more for the secondary schools, 550 more for the JCs (Junior Colleges) and I think we can get this by 2010, over the next six years.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	810	And overall, this will mean we'll have 15 per cent more teachers per student and it will make a difference in every school because it will help ensure that every student in the next generation emerges confident, fighting fit.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	811	What will we do with these teachers?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	812	I think we leave the schools to decide.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	813	They have their ideas, they have conviction of their ideas, let them decide.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	814	Each school has different students, it’s got different needs and the principals I met had different plans.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	815	Some want to shrink their class sizes so that the teachers can give more attention to their students.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	816	Some want to go for specialised teaching so that you'll have proper teachers teaching art, teaching music, teaching PE, rather than just generalised teaching by whoever is assigned.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	817	We don't have that yet in our primary schools.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	818	So, a teacher teaching art may not be qualified to teach art.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	819	The teacher teaching music, I hope she can sing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	820	But if we have a few more teachers, then we can make sure of it, train them and improve the standards.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	821	In some schools, they will devote the extra resources to counselling, for character-building or other special programmes like pastoral programmes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	822	I think that there are a lot we can do, and which we will do.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	823	But there is one thing which we shouldn't do and that is when we add more teachers, we better don't add more homework or increase the syllabus because that just defeats the whole purpose.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	824	Then we are back to square one.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	825	In fact, I think we should cut down on some of this syllabus.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	826	It would mean less pressure on the kids, a bit less rote learning, more space for them to explore and discover their talents and also more space for the teachers to think, to reflect, to find ways to bring out the best in their students and to deliver quality results.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	827	We've got to teach less to our students so that they will learn more.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	828	Grades are important – don't forget to pass your exams – but grades are not the only thing in life and there are other things in life which we want to learn in school.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	829	Parents are part of this and they've got to support the efforts of the schools when the schools are trying new teaching methods, or when they are trying to build character, or just toughening them up a little.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	830	I know some parents have gone to schools to complain, to say, "The other school has more worksheets".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	831	Even some kindergarten parents are complaining that their children are not getting worksheets and some kindergarten students are attending remedial classes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	832	No need.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	833	Let them grow up in their own time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	834	I know children are precious, we’ve got one, sometimes two.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	835	So, it's different.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	836	If we have four or five, well, you take a different attitude.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	837	But even with one or two, as parents, I think we have to let go a little.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	838	Take some risks as parents so that the children can learn, take some knocks, take some risks, grow up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	839	It's okay for children to get hurt.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	840	They fall down, bruise their knee, knock themselves, a few scrapes, can't be helped, it's part of growing up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	841	If you grow up with no scars anywhere, and you've never fallen off a bicycle, I think you are a different sort of person.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	842	I think not all parents are like this, to be quite fair.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	843	If you read the newspapers recently, we've had a lot of articles, letters, parents who feel their children should have more room to play, let them play football, let them get sweaty, use the PE periods for the right things, don't let it be eaten up by homework.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	844	I agree with them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	845	I think Tharman agrees with them, too, and I think the MOE agrees with them and will do something about it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	846	One particular aspect of education which a lot of parents worry about and which I want to talk about tonight is mother tongue, particularly Chinese language.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	847	We need to learn our mother tongue, both for our self-identity, and also because of Asia coming up… China, India… we need to be in with it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	848	The Europeans are learning Asian languages.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	849	If we don't, we are fools.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	850	I went to a semi-conductor factory in Shanghai.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	851	They showed me around, I found a woman there, European, speaking perfect Beijing hua (北京话) giving instructions.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	852	I think she was in charge of HR.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	853	So, I asked her, "你的华语是什么地方学的？
2004_lee_hsien_loong	854	(where did you learn your Mandarin?)", trying to put on my best Beijing qiang (accent). "
2004_lee_hsien_loong	855	是不是在北京学的?(Is it in Beijing?).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	856	She said, "在北京 ，也在威尼斯 ", (I learn it in Beijing and Venice).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	857	So, she learnt, she went to China and now, she's found a job.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	858	So if we want jobs, we better learn to speak too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	859	I went to Korea.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	860	They've got 35,000 students in China now learning Chinese.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	861	If we don't get our young people to learn the language, I think we are at a tremendous disadvantage.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	862	It will be a great loss.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	863	It's not easy, I can tell you from my own experience, either to learn the language or to maintain currency.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	864	I spent 12 years in a Chinese school – first language, Chinese, but my first language was English and till today, if I don't use Chinese after a few weeks or a few months, it gets rusty.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	865	“生锈了” (rusty) is the politest description and when CNA comes and wants to interview me, I have to practise and work on it, brush up and get the vocabulary and the grammar and the flow and the intonation back again before I am presentable.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	866	That's the way language is learnt, but that's what you have to do.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	867	It's part of my job, it's worth the effort and each time I visit China or Taiwan or Hong Kong, I realise what a valuable asset I have to be able to talk to them, understand them and have them feel that I understand them, but always remembering that I am Singaporean, they are Chinese or PRC Chinese.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	868	So, we've got to get our mother tongue, Chinese language education properly done in schools.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	869	It's a sweat for a lot of kids.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	870	It's difficult to do, but it's something which we have to improve on.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	871	What are our objectives?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	872	I will put three.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	873	First, we must establish at least a basic literacy for every Chinese student, basic modicum, everybody must pass, be able to speak, be able to listen, write a little bit, read a little bit more, but speak and listen.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	874	Secondly, we want to arouse an abiding interest in the Chinese Language (CL).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	875	We want people to want the language.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	876	If you make them fed-up with it, you have failed.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	877	If they hate it, you've wasted your time and if you try too hard, that may happen.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	878	You can try too hard in school, you can try too hard at home as parents and everyday read “成语故事” (stories of idioms).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	879	After a while they say, "How about Mickey Mouse or Harry Potter?"We've got to arouse interest and for those who can go further and have an interest in it, I think we should help them to go further to develop an abiding interest in the language, in the culture, in the society and in the contemporary events in China, what's happening now, not just what's happening hundreds of years ago.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	880	So, we've got to adapt our teaching of CL to our different pupils, to the different language backgrounds of the students, firstly, because whether you come from a Chinese language background at home or an English-speaking background is a tremendous difference to your starting point when you are in P1 (Primary 1) and you have to acknowledge that when you teach.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	881	We've got to acknowledge the wide range of language abilities of our pupils.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	882	Some can be bicultural, almost equally facile in both languages, some master just one, and already struggling.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	883	Others master one and a second at a CL2 level or CL2-minus level.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	884	They are different.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	885	You have to acknowledge that they are different and even among siblings, some will go for CL1, some will struggle with CLB (simplified Chinese Language B syllabus).
2004_lee_hsien_loong	886	We have to acknowledge this and adapt.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	887	If you force CLB pupils to memorise strokes and phrases and characters and proverbs, regardless of aptitude, then you are just going to turn them off.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	888	But if we help them learn the language, if we help them use it in daily life, give them opportunities to try it out, to make use of it, to see that it's a living language, to know the stories behind the proverbs, then we can arouse their interest, then we can lay a foundation in their minds which will be a permanent foundation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	889	So, later on in life, if they are going to China, if they are going to work there, six months a year, with the immersion, they will improve and they can use the language.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	890	Get enough so that if you go and you need to use it later on, you can revive it, warm it up
2004_lee_hsien_loong	891	and it's there.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	892	But the foundation must be there.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	893	And we've got to teach the language as a living language, not as an academic subject, not like a dead language like Latin.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	894	So, this means focusing on spoken – 听，讲, listen and speak – less emphasis on writing, a little bit more emphasis on reading.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	895	Still learn to write and the Higher Chinese people will learn to read and write equally, but for the people who are going to use it in their daily lives, listening and speaking, I think, is easier, is achievable and we should shift the weight so that more of the weight is on listening, speaking and reading, less on writing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	896	And I think we will have a better result that way.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	897	We also have to establish a conducive environment outside the classroom where the students can speak CL to each other and can reinforce the learning of the language.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	898	So, I think what we need and what MOE is going to do is a modular approach, have different modules for different students.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	899	Everybody will do the core module, that's standard.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	900	If you are a weak student, we will give you additional foundation modules, bridging, reinforcement.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	901	So, you will learn the lessons a bit more, where you didn't quite master it, you catch up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	902	If you have the skills, if you want to go further, we should let you do it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	903	Not just the top 10 per cent or 20 per cent or even the top 30 per cent, but any student who has that language skill, let him do it, have enrichment modules, advanced modules, he can learn more.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	904	And I think this way, with a tailor-made system, each person, as they say in Chinese, "因材施教" – adapt your teaching to the talent you have, to the talent of each student, then I think we'll have a better result and a more effective outcome.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	905	At the top, of course, we want some students who are almost equally proficient in English as well as Chinese.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	906	I think what we should aim to do is to develop a core, maybe about 200 students, who are in a bicultural programme, who will master Chinese language and culture, who will understand contemporary China.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	907	So, we will develop a programme – we've been working on it – which is more focused, more intensive.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	908	It will include a segment where the students are immersed in China, spend a few months there or a few weeks there, studying, living with a family and we will have a scholarship programme.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	909	We call it the SAP Scholarship because we're going to do this in the SAP schools, just like we have a Promsho programme and a Promsho Scholarship.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	910	So, the SAP Scholarship will provide the core and they can study, and beyond that, they will get scholarships to go on, we hope, Chinese university combined with someone in the West and they can come back, they can serve, can be in the public sector, can be in the private sector, can be on their own in business eventually.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	911	With this bilingual ability, I think they will be in demand.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	912	This is just a sketch.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	913	The details will come later, but the key thing is we have to adapt our language teaching for Chinese and what we do for Chinese, we should also do for our other languages because we are a multiracial society, not a Chinese society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	914	Individuals may be bicultural, but as a society, we have to be multicultural and within our society, we must have people who understand Malaysia, who understand Indonesia, who know India, who know the region and who can connect us up with it and take advantage of the opportunities there and help us to understand our neighbours and interpret them so that we are not in a different world from the rest of the people living in our region.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	915	The same problems in teaching Chinese, I think, apply to the other languages, too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	916	I know many Tamil parents or Indian parents, their children learning Tamil, tell me their children sweat blood, so we have to work at their standards because we have to set them at a realistic level.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	917	The Malay students, I don't have so much of a problem because up to now, most Malay families speak Malay at home, but we are beginning to see, 1 or 2 per cent Malay families, professionals speak English at home, going to school, Malay is a foreign language.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	918	So, we will have to, what we do for Chinese, I think we will also do, when there is a demand for the Malays and for the Indians, not just to be fair, but to do the right thing and to make sure that Singapore stays multicultural and we retain this unique strength of our society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	919	XI BabiesI have one last subject.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	920	It's very late, but I think I will talk about it all the same and this is babies.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	921	It's a very serious problem for us and for all the developed countries.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	922	Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Europe.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	923	Even the Catholic countries in Europe, Italy has a very low fertility rate, Spain too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	924	The only exception is America where immigration is very high and somehow, the culture is completely different.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	925	It's a national problem for us, but it's also an intensely personal business.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	926	I asked when did previous Prime Ministers raise such delicate matters?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	927	My people tell me, Mr Lee raised it in his 18th National Day Rally.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	928	What about Goh Chok Tong?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	929	He waited for his tenth National Day Rally.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	930	This is my first one.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	931	So, new baby, please be understanding.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	932	Our approach is, let's put it like this -- this is a matter of values, not of incentives.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	933	It's values and priorities, not the financial grants and subsidies, which count.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	934	We want people to have babies because you want them and you love them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	935	It's part of a happy family life.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	936	It's fulfilling to bring up a child.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	937	You can have the most successful career, you can be the richest man on Earth or the most powerful man or woman on Earth, but if you don't have a family and don't have children, I think you're missing something.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	938	It starts off with missing changing nappies when you have a child, but then you miss watching a child learning to walk, learning to talk, going to school, getting sick, depending on you, walking with you, playing with you.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	939	You are teaching him, doing homework with him or her.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	940	Then you'll find that he's got his own temperament, character, personality, he’s different from you.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	941	He's got his own ideas and after a while, one day, you are helping him or her do homework
2004_lee_hsien_loong	942	and he says, "No, no, you do it like this" and I look puzzled and I don't quite know what he is talking about, but he does
2004_lee_hsien_loong	943	and you know he's taken a step forward
2004_lee_hsien_loong	944	and he's on his own.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	945	And then they grow up a bit more and you have to, come a time when they ring up and say, "Can you pick me up at the cineplex?"
2004_lee_hsien_loong	946	Then you will worry whether they have found girlfriends or boyfriends.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	947	Then you will worry if they have not found girlfriends or boyfriends and you will think by the time they are 20 years old, they would have grown up, but actually, even when they are 50 years old, if I'm still around, I will still be fussing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	948	"Drink your pao shen" (泡参ginseng), take care of yourself, don't overstrain because my parents do that
2004_lee_hsien_loong	949	and I think if I'm still compos mentis, I will do that too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	950	So, these are not things you can translate into dollars and cents, or careers and promotions.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	951	It's fulfilling.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	952	It's sad if you don't have it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	953	We wish every Singaporean do and have a couple of children, three, if you can.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	954	It's difficult, yes, people say quality time, but actually, some of my friends who have three children say "economies of scale" because with three of them, they form an ecosystem.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	955	They learn from each other, they take care of each other, the older ones look after the small ones, which means they learn.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	956	The small ones learn to share with the big ones, which means they also learn and if you only have one and you spend quality time with him and he goes to school and the teacher cannot spend quality time with him, and his friend borrows his eraser, he may punch his friend on the nose.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	957	So, have two, three.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	958	I won't say have half-a-dozen but have a couple.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	959	We are not going to micromanage your lives.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	960	I mean, we won't say, have the first one by 25 years old, the second one by 30 years old.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	961	It’s up to you.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	962	What we can do is we'll make it easier for families to marry and to have children.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	963	You make the decisions.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	964	But I think what we have to do is to change attitudes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	965	We've got to change attitudes of the singles, of the couples and also of employers.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	966	It’s probably easiest with the employers, you just have to persuade them that they have to be fair to their staff -- parents, mothers who have children, give them time off, give them some flexibility.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	967	Women who are pregnant, be fair to them and don't sack them because they are about to have a baby.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	968	And if you look at the more successful companies, IBM, Hewlett Packard, the American companies, they are very good employers in this respect.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	969	They look after their staff.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	970	It's not just the Government.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	971	We try to be good employers, but they are doing it for commercial reasons and it makes sense for them because they know if they take care of their staff properly, their staff will be loyal to the company and will perform.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	972	Harder to change is the attitudes of singles.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	973	They need to have realistic expectations.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	974	Don't look for the impossible.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	975	If you go for MCS soap opera standard, then no hope.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	976	What do I mean by being realistic?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	977	I give you a couple of examples.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	978	First one is from a very experienced grassroots leader friend of mine who said he counselled his niece many years ago.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	979	She was single in her late 20s.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	980	He says, "You must get a husband".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	981	She said, "But I must find a man who will tell jokes to me, entertain me, pick me up if I am down, look after me in the evenings".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	982	So, he told her, "You don't need a husband, you need a TV set".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	983	So, she took his advice to heart, got married and is now happily married with children.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	984	I should bring him into SDU (Social Development Unit) council some day.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	985	But I asked SDU, do you have problems of high expectations?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	986	They said, "Yes".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	987	So, I said, "Give me some examples.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	988	Don't give me statistics, just give me some examples".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	989	So, they gave me a couple.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	990	One person said he wants a girl, tall, long hair, intelligent, fair, no spectacles, I don't know what other particulars he specified.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	991	So, SDU worked very hard, went through the files, produced the girl – tall, long hair, everything, but wore specs.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	992	He went out with the girl, came back, says, "Change".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	993	So, the SDU matchmaker says, "Why?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	994	She’s a perfectly fine lady, why don't you want her?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	995	She's wearing specs.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	996	Okay, change, she can wear contact lenses".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	997	He said, "No.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	998	If she wears specs, bad genes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	999	Children will wear specs".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1000	So, I asked, what about him?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1001	He also wore specs.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1002	So, he's still single.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1003	Another one says, "I want a girl, this, that, the other, preferably stay in Bukit Timah".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1004	So, matchmaker found him somebody nice, suitable social background, so on.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1005	Problem?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1006	She stayed in Bukit Merah.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1007	Wrong Bukit.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1008	"So, I think it's not the matchmaker's fault, right?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1009	I think we've got to change our mindsets and be realistic and accommodating.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1010	I think couples, too, have to change their mindset because we have to share the responsibility more equally and more fairly.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1011	In the old days, the man worked, the woman looked after the family.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1012	Man brought home the bacon, the woman brought up the kids, and for a lot of homes, they are still like that.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1013	If you have done Meet-the-People sessions, you will know.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1014	We've seen a lot of women who've been deserted by their husbands, husbands left, not paid maintenance, trying to go to court, come to look for us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1015	But we very seldom see a husband come, deserted by a woman who's not paid him maintenance and needs our help.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1016	That's the reality of our society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1017	It's patriarchal, but that's the way it has worked.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1018	So, because of that, we've always said, for government medical benefits, for the man, your wife and children can get.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1019	For the woman, husband and children cannot get because husband is supposed to take care of you, not you of your husband.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1020	But a lot of women have felt very angry about this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1021	I know Irene feels strongly.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1022	I think Indranee, Penny, they are all watching me carefully and the reality is changing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1023	The reality is changing, our society is changing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1024	The women are working, they are going out.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1025	Ten years ago, I don't think you could have imagined a women's team wanting to go and climb Mount Everest, but today, there is and I think that if we're going to talk about shared responsibility, if we are going to shift and try and get couples to split more evenly the duties of bearing and bringing up children, I think we should move.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1026	So, after many years, after thinking this over many times and picking up the stone and putting it back again and again, we will now decide to equalise medical benefits for men and women under the new medical schemes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1027	The older schemes which are moribund, we will extend it to their children because I think for the older schemes, there are Civil Service complexities, but for the new schemes, let's treat it as equal.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1028	So, philosophically, I accept.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1029	The private sector is doing it, I am doing it, but make sure your husband looks after you.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1030	I've got a lot of feedback from the public since March when we had the Budget and I said we're studying this and Hng Kiang is chairing a committee and some of these are very sensible feedback on what we should do as our package for procreation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1031	I'd like to read you just one letter which came in the email.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1032	I've got the permission from the person.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1033	So, let me tell you what she asked for.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1034	She said, "Dear Sir, I am married with a four-year-old son and currently five months-plus pregnant with a pair of twins.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1035	We planned to employ a foreign maid to take care of the babies.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1036	However, we realised that the maid levy is so much and the maid's salary is so much, excluding her meals".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1037	Then she added up -- full-day childcare and she already has a son, newborn expenses and so on.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1038	"I am writing sincerely to seek your kind assistance.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1039	One, maid levy -- we hope to pay a lesser amount of maid levy monthly, if possible.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1040	Two, Medisave for hospital bill -- this time round, I plan to have a Caesarean delivery, thus the hospital bill may be slightly higher.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1041	I am worried that I may have to fork out a lot of cash on hospital bills.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1042	So, I sincerely hope that we can utilise more Medisave so that we do not have to fork out so much cash.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1043	Three, maternity leave (feedback only) -- like any other mothers, we feel that eight weeks of maternity leave is quite short.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1044	If possible, an additional of four or eight weeks will really be beneficial and valuable to both the mother and the baby.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1045	My estimated due date is around beginning of September.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1046	I thank you for your precious time in reading my mail, sincerely hope that you can understand my situation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1047	Your kind assistance will be very much appreciated".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1048	I thought this was a very sensible letter because the things she asked for are, in fact, the things which mothers need – maid, delivery expenses, leave.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1049	So, I checked up whether her baby is born.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1050	She says, "Not yet, two weeks more".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1051	So, I will deliver my package before she delivers her baby.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1052	I will just sketch out the rough outlines and Lim Hng Kiang will tell you all about it in a few days' time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1053	Childcare – it's a key concern of mothers, both the caring and looking after of their kid when he's young, also the bonding, to form that special tie between mother and baby when the child is growing up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1054	What do you need that will evolve as the infant grows?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1055	First few weeks, you need the maternity leave, then you have infant care, then you have childcare, then a little bit older, you still need help around the family.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1056	So, for maternity leave, having gone through employers, employees, unions and so on, what we will do is we will extend the leave from eight weeks to 12 weeks – four more weeks.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1057	We will go from three children to four children and the Government will reimburse the extra expenses because if we just put it on the employer, I think it's not fair and the employer will say, "I prefer not to have a woman".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1058	Infant care – this is a gap in our system.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1059	Now, we have childcare subsidies but we don't have infant care subsidies which are commensurate because infant care is a lot more expensive than childcare.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1060	You need almost one caregiver for two babies.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1061	So, we will introduce a Centre-based Infant Care subsidy similar to the childcare subsidy but higher.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1062	I think it's S$400 per month.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1063	Then we'll have childcare leave – this is a new thing, so let me explain what it is.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1064	We could have had, say, five weeks more of maternity leave at the beginning when the baby is born, but we decided, let's have four weeks more and keep this extra one week and let's spread it out over, say, the first seven years of the child's life, two days a week.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1065	So, that's actually two weeks more, two days a week over seven years.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1066	So, if you are a parent, a father or a mother with a child below seven, then every year, you are entitled to two days of childcare leave.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1067	We will change the law.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1068	Which means if your child is sick, you can do it, if your child needs to see the kindergarten teacher, you can take a day off.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1069	You want to take a day off with the child, go to the zoo on a Monday.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1070	It can also be done.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1071	Two days a year, provided the child is below seven, no matter how many children you have below seven.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1072	Then, maids – a lot of parents have asked for maid levy to be made lighter
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1073	and I think there’s something in it because one of the ways we can ease the burden for working mothers, or even non-working mothers in Singapore, is to let them have maids, which they can't do in many other countries.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1074	If you are living in America, or in Australia, or in Britain, you won't have a maid help you at home.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1075	At most, you have a cleaning lady come in once a week or twice a week, but a maid in the home is something that we’re lucky to have in Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1076	But there is a levy
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1077	and I think it's right if you have a child, we lower the cost.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1078	So, we will lower the maid levy for families with children below 12 years old.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1079	Grandparents – grandparents are a tremendous help to families who have children.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1080	All the MPs I talked to say so.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1081	If they haven't had grandparents, they couldn't have managed, either their own parents or their in-laws.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1082	All the grassroots leaders say so.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1083	There are even scientific studies of pre-modern societies, Finland and Canada, which showed – they checked all their church records – that if you have a grandmother below 60 living within ten miles, you have two extra surviving grandchildren because the grandmother will help to look after them, will help to guide them, will spot what's wrong and no doubt will nag you to have a few more children.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1084	And I can tell you they make a tremendous difference.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1085	I have benefited from this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1086	If I did not have my parents or my mother-in-law helping to look after two very young kids in 1984, when Chok Tong asked me to come in, you may feel National Service, you may want to serve, can you do it?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1087	But I had the 亲母 (mother-in-law) at home.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1088	I had my parents bringing the children out for walks in the evenings.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1089	I come home at night, they are asleep, but I know that they have been fed, attended to, disciplined, if necessary.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1090	Everything is in hand.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1091	And so, I came in, no maid levy discount, no grandparent incentive, but the grandparents made the difference.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1092	And I think for many families, it's like that
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1093	and so, I think we should have some incentives which are targeted towards families which have old folks at home, on tax and also on the maid levy and this, we will do.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1094	Next, financial support – I won't talk a lot about this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1095	We have various tax breaks, all kinds of them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1096	We will improve them and tidy them up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1097	We also have a Baby Bonus which is now for the second and third child.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1098	I think we want to spread it out so that we're not just focusing on this specific child.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1099	So, what we will do is we will extend it to the first, second, third and fourth children.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1100	Finally, I think we need a better work life balance.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1101	Apart from high expectations being the reason why young people don't get married, another reason is they are simply too busy.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1102	They are working.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1103	If they are lawyers, they may finish at eleven o'clock at night.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1104	If they are civil servants working at MTI, maybe ten o'clock at night.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1105	No time to go out, socialise, make friends.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1106	Married couples also need good work life balance.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1107	I think we are working longer hours.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1108	I am not sure why, but hours have become longer, the pace is more intense.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1109	Maybe it's the Internet, maybe it's email, maybe it's globalisation, but whatever it is, you wake up at six o'clock in the morning, you check your email.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1110	Eleven o'clock at night, before you go to sleep, you check it again and next morning, you come back, somebody replied at 2.00 am.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1111	How to have children?The Government has a solution for everything.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1112	So, because of this, we have a Family Life Officer in every ministry.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1113	So, one ministry had a Family Life Officer who sent out a notice to the whole ministry, circular, email, cc all, saying you must maintain good balanced family life, stay at home, paid holiday, quality life, so forth
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1114	and she sent it out at 11.00 pm from her office PC.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1115	I don't know whether she's been sacked yet, but I think we have to keep a balance.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1116	There has to be on-time and off-time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1117	The US has got a good practice, five-day week.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1118	They work like mad, Mondays to Fridays.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1119	Breakfast meeting, 7.00 am, dinner, post-dinner meeting, 10.00 pm, 11.00 pm.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1120	Friday night, work late; Saturday, Sunday sacrosanct, absolute no-no.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1121	Never mind who you are, no business.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1122	They will save the time for their family, for their community, they do social work.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1123	Totally different personality.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1124	They coach a basketball team.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1125	They work hard, five-day week.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1126	Other countries are different.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1127	Five-day week, by Thursday afternoon, your weekend is getting close.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1128	We have always resisted a five-day week.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1129	I have made this argument many times.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1130	When I went into Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), they put up a paper, I said, "No".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1131	Last year, they were about to put up a paper.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1132	Before they could put it up, I had already answered somebody else "no" in the newspapers.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1133	So, they withdrew their proposal.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1134	But, in fact, it is one of the most important things for our young people and when we talk to employees coming in or staff coming in and ask them, "What is it which you are looking for?", the first thing they ask us is, "Do you work on Saturdays?" because they want that time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1135	Two days of a weekend is different from one-and-a-half days of a weekend.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1136	So, after having said, "No" for a very long time, I think it is time to turn this stone over also.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1137	So, the Civil Service will go to a five-day week.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1138	I didn't know you were all civil servants!
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1139	It will apply also to schools and army camps, but we will not reduce the official working hours.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1140	So, whatever it is, 44 hours, you have to do, you cover that during the week.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1141	And if the public counter is open on Saturdays, has to be open on Saturdays, we will keep it open on Saturdays.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1142	So, five-day week doesn't mean everybody is off on Saturday.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1143	Some people may be off on Monday or some other day of the week.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1144	Now, I wanted to say that I was going to go to work on Saturday, but the civil servants told me, please don't say that, but I can tell you I would be checking my email on Saturday and I'm sure for the ministers and for the people who are in the political leadership, the weekends will be time for them to spend in the community with the grassroots and keeping in touch with the residents.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1145	So, let me recap.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1146	Lim Hng Kiang will announce all the details on Wednesday.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1147	You can ask him as well as his committee, which includes several ladies -- I think Amy Khor is on the committee and
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1148	Lim Hwee Hua – all the tough questions.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1149	My job is just to make the speech.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1150	This package by itself isn't going to solve the problem, but if it changes Singaporean mindsets towards marriage, family and children and causes people to think again and reorder their priorities in life, then I think it will contribute to turning the situation around.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1151	I haven't been able to cover every segment of society in detail tonight.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1152	I read today's Sunday Times – "What I would like to hear in the National Day Rally?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1153	" Everybody had a wish list and I think everybody has a right to wish for something – the disabled, the disadvantaged, the old, the young, the married couples, newly-married and so on.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1154	And when I talked about an inclusive society, I include all of them, but if I cover all of them tonight, you will not go home till midnight.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1155	But at the right occasion at the right events over the next few months and years, we will talk about them, we will address them and we will see to their needs because an inclusive society has to embrace all and everybody must have the chance to have a good life and to be part of this Singapore Story.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1156	XII Our future is brightWe are now in Singapore in a region where opportunities abound.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1157	It's the most dynamic region in the world.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1158	There is no other place where we would prefer to be.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1159	You want to be in Latin America, you have your problems.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1160	You want to be in Africa, God help you.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1161	But in Southeast Asia and Asia, for all the problems, for all the uncertainties and risks, I think this is a dynamic, exciting, challenging part of the world.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1162	Companies in Singapore are benefiting from this.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1163	Our local companies are doing well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1164	You look at Mustafa’s, the amount of TV sets and things it sells going to India, and it's expanding.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1165	And the multinationals are doing well in Singapore, too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1166	The wafer fabs are doing well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1167	One of them told me a few months ago, he's got a plant in Ang Mo Kio, he says, "Your Ang Mo Kio plant produces five times as many wafers, discs as all their plants in the whole of Europe".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1168	I was very happy because Ang Mo Kio means Ang Mo Kio GRC, but they are doing well and they are exporting and they are creating jobs for our people.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1169	Our Singapore businesses are going abroad, too.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1170	All kinds of businesses are operating around in the immediate region.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1171	We've got manufacturing, logistics, real estate, hotels.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1172	Our household names are in Malaysia and Indonesia.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1173	You want to go to KL, you can get Crystal Jade, or you want to go Indonesia, Jakarta, you can get Crystal Jade, Tung Lok, BreadTalk.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1174	In fact, there is a BreadTalk in Shanghai, I opened it, as well as a KopiTiam.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1175	You want to go to KL, there's a Zouk (disco), it's quite funky, and many other projects like that.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1176	Our economy is thriving and competitive.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1177	We are getting new investments coming in, we are getting investments choosing Singapore overIndia, over China.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1178	So, we look at them as competitors, but I think we know that we are able to hold our own and because of our workforce, because of our quality, because of our policies and government, people are prepared to come, invest in Singapore and create jobs and prosperity for us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1179	Not just multinationals.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1180	Even Chinese and Indian companies are coming here.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1181	So, we've got 1,400 Indian companies, 1,200 Chinese companies inSingapore and EDB is quite confident.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1182	They are going full-steam ahead, bringing in new investments and we are quite confident that in 15 years, they can double our manufacturing output.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1183	And if EDB tells me that then I think they must have added, they must have kept back a small percentage for themselves.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1184	So, I think they will make the target.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1185	And we are having jobs, not just manufacturing jobs, but also in services.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1186	Banking is hotting up and because we have private banking and asset management and we have become a financial centre because we opened up, there are many jobs where we don't have the skilled people.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1187	Tourism – whether or not we have a casino, I think we will grow it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1188	Transport – SIA and PSA have downsized, but as they grow, after they have restructured, I think they will need staff again over time.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1189	And we are getting new sorts of industries, creative industries.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1190	You may have seen recently George Yeo opening, at the launch of a project, Lucasfilm.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1191	Lucasfilm are the people who made Star Wars with the swords and they're coming here, they're going to produce films, TV serials, games that blend East and West.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1192	And it means new jobs, exciting opportunities to create unique entertainment.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1193	And they’re very good jobs, jobs which require art, which require technology, IT, mathematics, business, jobs which our people are good at.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1194	If you want to be an animator, a cartoonist, you want to draw a storyline, you want to create special effects, you need brains as well as talent.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1195	I visited Weta Works in Wellington in New Zealand last year.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1196	They made Lord of the Rings, or they supported the people who made Lord of the Rings and we have some Singaporeans on attachment there, learning the craft.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1197	I was very impressed with them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1198	They've got the skills.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1199	It's very interesting.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1200	In the old days, you draw cartoons one by one, then you colour, then you draw the next one, then you flip over.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1201	Now, it's all on a computer.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1202	You have a model.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1203	So, you have a model of a puppet on a computer, or rather the puppet is the model.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1204	So, normally, with a puppet, you hold the strings.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1205	Here, with the puppet, you use your mouse, you slide the cursor, the puppet can raise his eyebrows, stick out his tongue, make a face at you or get angry and so, you can give a personality to the puppet.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1206	And our people have those creative skills and our polytechnics and our ITEs, it's not just the universities.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1207	Nanyang Polytechnic is producing good people who will be in demand for creative industries and we're talking about hundreds initially, later on maybe thousands, but it will make a contribution with good jobs for Singaporeans.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1208	The young ones here will remember and know what is Matrix: Reloaded.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1209	It's a movie.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1210	I haven't seen it, but I know about it
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1211	and it's a movie with special effects and you may remember that last year, they were showing it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1212	The smoke and explosions were done by a Singaporean called Nickson Fong.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1213	It's a very specialised business.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1214	He was a NAFA graduate.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1215	He went to Hollywood, he did all this and he was overseas.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1216	I met him last year when he came back and he said, "Well, one day, maybe I will come back, but right now the opportunity is not right, the opportunities are overseas".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1217	So, he went to Taiwan, he started something.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1218	But last week, he emailed me, he says, "I'm now back in Singapore", with pregnant wife, new baby, came back to Singapore to get born and he's setting up a company, Egg Story Creative Production so as to do this creative technology,
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1219	IT film production work.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1220	So, I think that there are opportunities and if I may borrow a young word, I think "The Force is with Singapore".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1221	We are building something unique and precious here.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1222	In a world full of strife, we have many races living in harmony.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1223	In a region where corruption is everywhere, we have a clean and meritocratic system.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1224	We invest in our young to help each one to find his strengths and realise his aspirations.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1225	We offer special opportunities to all to do well and also to contribute to Singapore and we spread widely the benefits of progress so that everybody benefits when the country does well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1226	And we are strengthening our national identity day by day.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1227	It's not yet a very long history, but year by year, with each crisis, with each joy and each sorrow, we build on it.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1228	So, when there is Sars, we bonded, when there's an economic crisis, we shared it, employers, workers, the Government.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1229	When we have tragedies like RSS Courageous or the Nicoll Highway collapse, ordinary people rose to the occasion to become heroes of the nation and for those who lost their lives, their memories are etched permanently in our collective memory.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1230	It's what the Chinese say, “歌于斯, 哭于斯, 聚国族于斯” – you weep here, you rejoice here, you gather your clan here.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1231	It's not a perfect society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1232	None is.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1233	But it's a society where if we have a problem, we can discuss it, we can find some way to resolve it, we can tackle it and if something is wrong, we will put it right.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1234	And so, over time, we will make progress.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1235	I think we have reason to be confident of our future.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1236	Very often, we ask ourselves, how are we going to fix these problems?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1237	Whither Singapore?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1238	We worry about our weaknesses and, indeed, we've got to tackle the problems which we have.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1239	But while we fix our weaknesses, we should not forget our strengths, and they are considerable, and others admire them and are trying to emulate them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1240	We are making friends with the Vietnamese.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1241	They are very keen to link up with us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1242	We have a connectivity proposal.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1243	They want to learn from us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1244	They want to learn from our experience, Temasek Holdings and its GLCs (Government-linked companies), the central bank, MAS, how we run the government, how we can open up and keep an orderly society.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1245	The Chinese, the cities and the provinces are very keen to learn from us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1246	When first, we went into Suzhou, they were not interested in software.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1247	Now, they say, "The Singapore model, what can we do with it?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1248	How can we benefit from this not just in Suzhou but in other cities and other provinces?".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1249	In India, our standing is high.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1250	In January, I went to Bangalore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1251	IT is booming away, they’ve a lot of problems but also great confidence.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1252	So, I visited an IT company.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1253	They asked me to talk to their crowd.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1254	So, they gathered everybody on the rooftop.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1255	I went up, gave a five-minute speech, practising for the National Day Rally.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1256	Just five minutes.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1257	So, I said, "The region is opening up, opportunities are there, India is opening up.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1258	Southeast Asia, Singapore, we offer you opportunities, the world is your oyster".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1259	They nearly gave me a standing ovation.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1260	So, if they can be confident of learning from us, there is no reason for us to doubt our ability to stay ahead of them and to keep on moving forward.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1261	And the key is to commit ourselves to the task, heart and soul, which is what our athletes in Athens have been doing.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1262	You've been watching the Games.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1263	I think you were watching table tennis before we started this evening.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1264	Ronald Susilo did well earlier.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1265	He beat the World No 1, then he lost in the quarter-finals.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1266	Li Jiawei beat the World No 2 in table tennis, but eventually, she lost and finished fourth.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1267	I spoke to Jiawei just now after her game.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1268	She was a bit down, of course.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1269	So, she said, "Well, I am in the top four.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1270	Very sad".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1271	I said, "There's no reason to be sad.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1272	We are proud of you.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1273	You've done us well.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1274	Yes, you've not got the top prize, but we will keep on trying.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1275	We will keep on trying.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1276	Sports isn't just medals.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1277	It's doing our best, trying, trying again, overcoming setbacks, depending on each other, being part of Team Singapore".
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1278	And many of our athletes have made Singapore their home
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1279	and they've become part of our family and we should welcome them and celebrate them.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1280	We may be small, but we have high hopes and big dreams and so long as we are a little red dot in the middle of Southeast Asia, let people know that we are a people who will keep on trying and never say die.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1281	And with this spirit, the future is ours to make.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1282	What do we see as a vision for Singapore?
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1283	I think this will always be work-in-progress because we will never be satisfied.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1284	We always want to move on, do better.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1285	But I think ours should be a future of opportunity and promise.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1286	We should have a prospering economy, creating good jobs for all and having opportunities for our people to venture and to create new businesses and new openings and new possibilities for ourselves.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1287	We should have an honest and capable government with leaders whom Singaporeans trust and can rely on.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1288	We should have an open society which is welcoming of talent, which welcomes diverse views, is yet cohesive and has a sense of common purpose.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1289	And we should be a community where every citizen counts, where everyone can develop his human potential to the full and everyone participates in building and repairing and upgrading this shared home which is Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1290	So, we have a lot going for us.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1291	Let's all work together to realise our dreams and to make this bright future for our people and for Singapore.
2004_lee_hsien_loong	1292	Thank you very much, indeed.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	1	My fellow Singaporeans,Every year, rain or shine, Singaporeans come together on the 9th of August for the National Day Parade, to celebrate the making of our nation, and renew our commitment to Singapore.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	2	National Day ParadeI have been privileged to attend almost every NDP since the first in 1966.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	3	One of the Parades I took part in was in 1968 at the Padang.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	4	The rain poured down, but the contingents stood steady, and marched past proudly, drenched, yet undaunted.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	5	We showed ourselves and the world that Singaporeans were rugged people, and had the steel in us to stand firm in adversity.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	6	Five years ago, SG50 was another memorable Parade.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	7	We celebrated our Golden Jubilee, and what we had achieved in Singapore.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	8	We also paid tribute to our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	9	We mourned his passing that year, but also affirmed what he and the pioneer leaders stood for.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	10	In good years, our parades rejoice in our progress, and look forward to a better future together.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	11	In difficult years, we still hold National Day Parades, to renew our resolve to weather the storm and take Singapore through to better days.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	12	This year, National Day falls amidst COVID-19.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	13	We are not able to celebrate in our usual way, but we are determined still to hold the Parade as a symbol of our unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	14	We will have a smaller Parade at the Padang, and also ceremonies at seven other locations around the island this morning.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	15	Each location will symbolise one aspect of our response to COVID-19 – Providing medical care for Singaporeans at NCID; supporting our workforce with skills and jobs at the Lifelong Learning Institute; keeping learning going for our students at North Vista Secondary School; or sustaining our community spirit at Kampung Admiralty.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	16	We look forward to Singaporeans across the island, and also in far-flung lands, joining the Parade virtually and celebrating with one another.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	17	We will all share special moments like when the Red Lions land, the mobile column reaches our town, or the State Flag is flown past.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	18	We will all recite the Pledge and sing Majulah Singapura in our hearts together.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	19	Stories of everyday heroesThis NDP is also an opportunity for us to salute those on our frontline, fighting COVID-19.Many of them have gone way beyond the call of duty, and shown great generosity of spirit.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	20	Retired doctors and nurses volunteered to come back, donning PPE to serve on the front lines, in hospitals and migrant worker dormitories.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	21	Full-time national servicemen extended their terms to continue supporting COVID-19 operations.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	22	Public officers volunteered to be redeployed to organise and look after the migrant workers.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	23	Many Singaporeans stepped up to help others in need.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	24	Some went door to door distributing meals and groceries to the elderly and low-income households.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	25	Others refurbished donated laptops for needy students, for home-based learning.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	26	Thousands of public-spirited Singaporeans volunteered to be trained for swab operations.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	27	They served in the hot zones, including the dormitories and community care facilities.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	28	Migrant workers too played their part to support these operations.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	29	Their help was deeply appreciated by our SAF, Home Team and public officers.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	30	These selfless acts have made all the difference to our response to COVID-19.Bracing for economic difficulties aheadWe will need this unity and resilience more than ever.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	31	The crisis is far from over.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	32	Many countries brought COVID-19 under control and eased restrictions, only to see their cases rise sharply again.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	33	This can happen to us too, despite all our precautions.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	34	It will most likely take a year or two before a vaccine is widely available, and the threat of the virus is blunted.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	35	Until then, we have to maintain our vigilance and resolve, to keep ourselves, our loved ones and our neighbours all safe.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	36	We also need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	37	Singaporeans are understandably anxious and worried.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	38	Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	39	But this is not the first economic crisis we have experienced.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	40	Just in the last quarter century, we have seen the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998), the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (2001), and the Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009).
2020_lee_hsien_loong	41	Each time the outlook was ominous, and we feared the worst, but each time we worked hard to secure our position, gritted our teeth, and came through together.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	42	I am confident we will get through this current crisis too, though it may take longer.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	43	All of us must do our part, but none of us will be alone.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	44	The government is actively helping people find new jobs and acquire new skills.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	45	We also have the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and Self-employed person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) to ease the burden on employers and individuals.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	46	The Labour Movement is working with employers to create job training programmes and career pathways.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	47	It will also ensure that every worker is treated fairly and with dignity, especially when job losses cannot be avoided.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	48	Employers too must make every effort to keep their workers, and not drop them at the first sign of trouble.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	49	This will build loyalty, and encourage the employees to help their employers rebuild when conditions improve.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	50	Our experience fighting COVID-19, grim and hard as it has been, has brought us closer together.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	51	The shared ordeal will toughen a whole population, and bond us together as one united people.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	52	Just like how the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations were tempered by Separation and Independence, and economic crises in our early years as a nation.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	53	Let us brace ourselves for the trials ahead, so that many years from now, when our grandchildren celebrate National Day, they will look back on these times and say yes, this generation stood together, sacrificed for one another, and built Singapore for us.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	54	NS SquareEvery National Day, we remind ourselves that Singapore is a nation whose story is worth celebrating, whose history is worth cherishing, and whose future is worth building.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	55	When we hold the National Day Parade at the Padang, or at the Float@Marina Bay, the audience can see the Marina Bay skyline in the background.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	56	Marina Bay used to be open sea, but we reclaimed the land around it, turned the ocean into a reservoir, and progressively built on the new land, to create an outstanding and vibrant downtown.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	57	Looking out across the Bay, you can immediately see how far Singapore has come, and imagine the possibility and promise that Singapore holds.

2020_lee_hsien_loong	59	It helps them to understand what they are defending, and why generations of national servicemen have been willing to serve and sacrifice, to defend this metropolis that we have built together, and also the society that created all this: Our families.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	60	Our friends.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	61	Our lives.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	62	Our future.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	63	Three years ago, I announced that we would rebuild the Float into a permanent space to commemorate National Service, and the central role that NS plays in Singapore, and that we would name this space, NS Square.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	64	The design contract has been awarded.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	65	This is how it will look like.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	66	The development will be aligned on a central axis, with The Promontory on the opposite side of the Bay.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	67	The platform will become a red dot, shining bright in our city.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	68	NS Square will be the central focus of our new downtown.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	69	We will build a gallery there to showcase our National Service story, and honour the contributions of national servicemen past and present.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	70	NS Square will also be a community space for everyone, young and old, to enjoy.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	71	And of course, we will continue to hold our National Day Parades there.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	72	ConclusionThis National Day, as we celebrate across the island, we will be saying the Pledge and singing Majulah Singapura in unison – not aloud as usual because of COVID- 19, but in our hearts, with more feeling than ever.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	73	We have dreams to realise, and goals to reach for.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	74	Let us show the world that whatever the challenges, Singaporeans will stay united, and prevail once more.
2020_lee_hsien_loong	75	I wish everyone a very happy National Day!
