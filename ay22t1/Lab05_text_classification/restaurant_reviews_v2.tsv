2862	Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	price	negative

2221	Too cold to enjoy.	ambience	negative
1542	As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	service	negative

562	Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.	ambience	negative
1551	Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.	ambience	negative
2840	Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.	service	negative
191	Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available.	service	negative
3059	The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.	food	negative
936	They never came back to refill our glasses again.	service	negative
189	Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.	service	negative

1704	One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food.	food	negative
3513	The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.	ambience	negative
1846	The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.	price	negative

2491	Aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks.	service	negative

1302	And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service!	service	negative
757	It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.	ambience	negative
1420	Note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own.	service	negative
564	We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.	service	negative

2363	Fish was overdone.	food	negative
1643	Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.	food	negative
2793	But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.	food	negative
3335	the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.	food	negative

771	For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.	service	negative
2236	The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.	food	negative

3274	Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware.	ambience	negative

1062	Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.	service	negative
567	Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.	food	negative
2209	This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.	food	negative
2835	This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.	service	negative

2218	Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.	ambience	negative
9	The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.	service	negative
1295	The counter service is bad.	service	negative

883	We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.	food	negative
2432	The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.	service	negative
3343	The food now is inconsistent.	food	negative
2988	Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order.	service	negative

1371	The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.	food	negative
2194	They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.	food	negative
2036	That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.	price	negative
3050	After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.	service	negative
834	A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.	ambience	negative
2754	Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.	price	negative
3250	They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.	service	negative
772	In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.	service	negative
2932	First, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them.	service	negative
3512	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.	service	negative

1353	Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.	service	negative
2700	I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table.	service	negative
3211	After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.	service	negative
3121	But the staff was so horrible to us.	service	negative
2771	Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.	ambience	negative
932	It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.	service	negative
1187	Alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice.	price	negative
3148	Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.	service	negative

1666	Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit	service	negative
1190	You have to increase the service a lot.	service	negative
2588	First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.	service	negative
2249	I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.	food	negative
3281	We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got.	price	negative
1407	The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.	ambience	negative
1713	Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!	price	negative
1228	I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!	service	negative
2522	like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.	service	negative

3278	The food was not very tasty, the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.	food	negative
3015	After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!	food	negative
2035	Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.	service	negative
1474	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	food	negative
1071	A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!	price	negative

184	The kitchen however, is almost always slow.	service	negative
1331	Why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?	service	negative
2544	I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.	ambience	negative
3672	The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.	service	negative

3122	The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.	service	negative
2859	As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.	service	negative

2667	The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.	service	negative
1031	You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.	service	negative
3134	The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.	service	negative

3265	I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	food	negative
