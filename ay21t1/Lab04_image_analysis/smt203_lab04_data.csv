@taiersingapore has been popular in China for 6 years now, and they have 300 outlets there! They opened their first store in Singapore recently and I got to try their signature 老坛子酸菜鱼 and it was so fresh and delicious! You HAVE to try it if you love 酸辣！Oh they also have some weird rules in which they 不加辣不减辣, and they claim the 酸菜 is tastier than the fish. I cannot decide if that is true because I love both equally 🥰

Note that the restaurant is so packed now they are currently not accepting walkins. If you are interested, you’ll have to make a reservation through their FB page (@taiersingapore) or contact them through WeChat: xjptaier/tjtaier3

This restaurant specialises in Iberico pork 🐷 so all their dishes feature this ingredient! In the menu, you'll see many kinds of ""don"" such as pork belly, shoulder, collar, jowl etc. There's a page on the many that helps to explain each cut so not to worry! 
.
I chose the Iberico Belly Don, which was only $10 ☺ super value for money in my opinion! Comes with an onsen egg and a good amount of meat. 
.
Also chose to top up an additional $6 for the set meal because I was super hungry that day 😆. There's 2 types of sets ($5 for 2 sides, $6 for 3 sides). I got the kimchi pork, iberico miso soup and a soft drink. 
.
Kimchi pork was actually really good 💯, shared with the fam and they liked it very much too haha. The kimchi is fresh, crunchy and has that tang and spice🌶🥬. A good kimchi i must say (from a self proclaimed kimchi connosieur 🤪🧐). It also came with some slices of meat which had a nice grilled taste. 🥓
.
The miso soup is your typical miso soup + 1-2 slices of pork, not much to say about it but i guess its good to have it to balance out the meatiness of the meal hehe. 🥣
.
Tried the crispy pork too (my other family members got this as their side) and to be honest, there's nothing nice about it. As the name says, its just crispy pork. Looks like a chicken karaage, but its kind of tasteless and in fact has a porky taste 🥴. Something good about this though is that the pieces of pork were quite generous and meaty, not like the ones just filled with flour. Clearly the winner is the kimchi pork! 🏆🥬🌶🥓

Please keep our families and loved ones safe during this unique situation we have! Watch over us… And cover us with your love! Shower us with good health, grace, mercy, and joy! Remove any worry, fear and doubt in our hearts!♥️ 

Comfort us Lord God esp for those who's hurting…
so many people already died and many are still suffering... 
It’s very heartbreaking to see posts/stories with friends 
changing their profile photos to candles and black images, 
a post of grievance and loss. Please take this plague, 
this Covid away, Lord.. and Grant each one of us 
a sense of repentance and care for one another... 
We know po that everything happens for a reason, 
it’s hard to accept and we may never understand 
at all, Please open our hearts to Your message
that we may see...what  it is that You want us 
to get and learn from all this...

Mother Mary, when you saw Your Son Jesus 
hanging on the cross, it must have been 
very heavy for you to carry, and yet you still obediently followed. 
Please teach us to have an obedient and trusting heart like yours, that despite this trial, it is not the end. That there is still hope...🌈 
And make all of us, whole again!🙏

Thank you, LORD!

Who would have thought that few months after that day the world will slow down because of Covid, and honestly it's never easy and I'm not okay until the early part of this year. 

After more than a year, the end still seems unclear, yet what I come to realize is that it's not acceptance but SURRENDER, surrender to God the things not in your control, count your blessings and be grateful and pray because prayers turn our fears and doubts to hope. Hope brings us forward. It helps us to endure 🙌🏻❤️

Hi, Ladies! 

Sudah bilang terima kasih sama dirimu belum? 
Sudah bilang cinta sama jiwamu? 
Sudah menepuk bahu dan bilang, you are doing great, hatiku?

Meski masalah datang silih berganti, air mata jatuh tanpa bisa dibendung lagi, kecewa datang menghampiri, percayalah itu tanda kita masih punya hati. 
Meski terkadang ""being numb"" cukup membantu melewati hari. 
Jangan sering-sering, nanti rasamu jadi makin mati. 

Turunkan saja ekspektasimu pada sesuatu atau seseorang itu. 
Belajarlah untuk lebih banyak berdialog hanya dengan dirimu.
Nyatakan kesukaan dan ketidaksukaanmu pada banyak hal.
Jangan khawatir, tak ada yang bisa menghakimi apapun yang ada di akal. 

Tak perlu banyak mengaduh atau mengadu. 
Anggap saja semua masalahmu adalah cara-Nya menunjukkan kekuatanmu.
Kekuatan yang tak kau tahu hingga saatnya perlu. 

Belajar juga untuk memaafkan diri sendiri, kita masih manusia ini. 
Tempatnya salah dan kerap mengulangi. 
Namanya juga proses mengenali diri. 
Asal berani dan ingat untuk selalu mengapresiasi.
Tak perlu berharap setengah mati didapat dari orang lain.
Cukup seduh secangkir kopi seraya berbisik, ""Terima kasih, DIRI!""

Love, Rere

And another study suggests your muscle size can decrease by about 11% after ten days without exercise, even when you aren't bed ridden. 

That’s why we need to exercise every few days at the minimum to maintain our muscles. And unfortunately for me, since I’ve sprained my ankle half a year ago, all my strength are gone. 

It’s really tough trying to get back into form. My body is flabby all over and I need to start from zero again. Whoever is finding hard to exercise again, I’m with you!! 💪🏻

I chose the Vegan Set ($9.90), a first by her, and enjoyed it very much. For me, the star was undoubtedly the rice -  it was as light, fluffy and aromatic as I recall. But that’s not to say I didn’t relish every bite of the beancurd, two sambal stirfries of crunchy sambal goreng and mushy-soft brinjal, because I most certainly did. There was also the fried pieces of tempeh, fresh cucumber slices and a very appetising spicy and tangy chilli sambal that rounded off my vibrant-coloured serving.
@huatkaliao hoovered up every bit of his Chicken Rendang Set ($9.90) which had a whole thigh (it’s tender, moist and saturated in the rich and spicy rempah gravy), a fried egg, ikan bilis, cucumber and two kinds of chilli sambals. 
What’s really interesting is that this is the first time Chef Shen has prepared her Nasi Lemak completely pork-free. In fact, the stall is pending approval for their application of a halal license.

Since its completion in 2012, the gardens have become a global phenomenon and attract millions of visitors a year. 

Among the standout features are the famous Supertree structures. These offer an impressive skywalk over the gardens, with oversized seashell-shaped greenhouses that recreate chilly mountain climates. 18 distinctive Supertrees and 2 cooled Conservatories provide futuristic landmarks. The Flower Dome provides an indoor environment for plants from the Mediterranean climate and the Cloud Forest is home to endangered species from tropical cloud forest.

Don't miss the spectacular sound and light show at night.
