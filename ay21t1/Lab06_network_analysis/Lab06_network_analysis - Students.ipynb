It is important to remember that centrality measures are used on specific nodes within the network, and do not provide information on a network level. There are several centrality measures, but this guide will cover degree, closeness, and betweenness.\n",

    "* **Closeness**: Closeness measures how well connected a node is to every other node in the network. A node’s closeness is the **average number of hops required to reach every other node** in the network. A hop is the path of an edge from one node to another. For example, as seen in the diagram below, Node A is connected to Node B, and Node B is connected to Node C. For Node A to reach Node C it would take two hops.\n",
    "* **Betweenness**: Betweenness measures the importance of a node’s connections in allowing nodes to reach other nodes (in a hop). A node’s betweenness is the **number of shortest paths the node is included in divided by the total number of shortest paths**. This will provide the percentage of shortest paths in the network that the node is in.\n",
